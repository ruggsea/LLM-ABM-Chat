{"text":"he hasn't actually DONE anything","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"he was only in office for 9 months before he got the award","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"he wasn't able to actually achieve anything important within that time","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"exactly","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"he had some great ideas though","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I really liked the Time article about it though","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"\"This prize, to a 48-year-old freshman president, for \u201cextraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples,\u201d seemed a kind of prayer and encouragement by the Nobel committee for future endeavor and more consensual American leadership.\"","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I do think he was taking a step in the right direction","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"you have to look at the purpose of the award and this guy Mr. Nobel from Sweeden - his intention - i believe though, that the Nobel Peace prize came after other Nobel Prizes - and the criteria the committee considered for the winner","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and the Nobel was a carrot on a stick to keep us moving in that direction","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yes, but in that sense he deserves it - if you look at in the context of American leadership in the past decade -","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i feel as though it's been awarded prematurely","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"based on previous accomplishments, I would agree with you shania","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I think he did some wonderful things opening up a dialogue with other countries","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and that's definitely in line with the Peace Prize, but I don't know if it's enough","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and how his administration signaled a change in tone -to more cooperative relations as opposed to unilateral","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"he has instilled a renewed sense of hope in people around the world and that is wonderful","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"that's the entire purpose of the peace prize, so by your very statement - you paint a compelling argument as to why he deserves it","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yet i feel to deserve it there needs to be some tangible outcomes","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"to his initiatives, i mean","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"What is a tangible outcome when we're talking about peace?","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"you also have to consider the other candidates - the competition - basically, the peace prize is based on influence","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"you cannot create peace and cooperation among people w\/o influence - and","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"it is unlikely his competitors enjoyed the influence he did , and therefore they would be unable to match his efforts toward cooperation b\/n people","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he's showing interest in peace, but at that point in time no particular accomplishments were made","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"this is true david","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}

{"text":"Hi, just arrived and will catch up by reading your posts now....","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Conventional-Opening"}
{"text":"i agree that he has a certain influence but what has come of his initiatives as of now?","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I wonder if Nicolas Sarkozy would have made a better choice","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"the article said that carter won in 1992, how many years after his presidency?","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I was reading earlier about the Georgia\/Russia conflict","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and he mediated it","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well - also - he did have accomplishments - i would assert that gaining the presidency is an accomplishment, especially representing such a historically disadvantaged group","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he brought more people into the electorate than ever before","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he is an historical figure already and i feel as though he will do great things as a world leader but im not convinced","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"if anything they are giving it to him because he is of a different race, and not on his character","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I'm not sure his being voted president would count as promoting international communication\/peace","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"I agree with the idea of looking for tangible results","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I do not believe he was ready to receive the peace prize","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"agreed","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"well - whether he will do great things as a leader is not really relevant - unless you want to argue that the committee awarded him the prized based on expectation, which is not actually a bad addition to the argument for why he deserves it","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Piedad C\u00f3rdoba also helped successfully mediate a conflict","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"Sarkozy mediated the Russia\/Georgia conflict","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"isn't the prize supposed to be awarded to someone who has displayed action to warrant a change or effort to the world..","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Sarkozy just has sex with countless young women - that's basically his accomplishment if you ask the French people - not very related to peace across people","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"sex is someone's personal life, it does not impact the entire world or peace...","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I don't think personal lives are really related to the prize","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i agree with shania","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"and vicky","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}

{"text":"Sarkozy *","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"I was just looking through 2009 conflicts","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}

{"text":"right, vicky","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"he obviously made some contribution to be nominated","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Obama has not yet been involved in any actual resolutions","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"okay - so Sarkozy \"obviously\" made some contributions to be nominated - and","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"obama has started new talks between palestinians and isrealis but we have yet to see any real progress","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"we should just defer to the committee's judgement bc he was nominated? yet we can't trust their judgement on the person","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"they actually picked to win?","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"i agree with laurens recommendation so far- actual resolution is key to the prize process","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"link","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes it makes sense","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"It looks like he is trying to make steps in the Middle East too, although obviously that's not a quick resolution","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"okay, well there is no peace in the Middle East - so we can basically discount that wikipedia link","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"of course it won't be","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I'm not saying he should have had the peace prize necessarily","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"but just comparing Obama to someone else who seems to have more tangible results I think is useful","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"definitely","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"and an actual resolution would include hope - you cannot devalue that - bc it is incredibly important - he definitely mobilized a segment of the population that were incredibly marginalized in the political process","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"those who have won in the past like nelson mandela have truly made peace and equality a reality for many and deserve to have won it","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"I don't think Sarkozy measures up - basically i disagree there","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"david, you mentioned earlier how the administration set a different tone, is there anyone from that administration other than Obama you place in this category of deserviing the prize?","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"the US administration, macy?","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"well - it's not really whether they should receive the prize, the idea of this chat focuses on Obama - i don't want to stray from the topic too much - but -, i wouly say proly not to answer your question directly","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I don't think it strays from the topic, david","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"Obama winning the prize is based on him deserving it more than anyone else in the world for 2009","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"so we have to look at other people with international accomplishments","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"oh the way i saw the topic, was if we were in agreement that obama did not deserve, then we need to choose someone else that is. So, i guess i was just seeing if you had any suggeestions since some of us arent going the obama way. Not that you need to change your mind, just to get some ideas thrown around.... :)","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"- well - basically - even more than achievements in science and medicine and other categories, influence is very crucial to the Nobel Peace Prize - if you do not have influence, you can not be considered -","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Oh, you're right macy","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"hen do you think that he may be eligible in the future and who would you pick to win this time.","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"if we decide Obama didn't deserve it, we do pick someone else","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"right- influence seems to be key, i agree","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"oh of course","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i would say obama is ABSOUTELY on the track to win for the future","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"being influential is key to success in promoting anything, let alone peace","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so this leaves a very small pool of eligible applicants","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yes, david","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"true","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"and out of that handful of people, it should go to Obama - i mean who else can you think of ?","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"i was looking at the list of past winners","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"and i'm sorry to say i'm not knowledgeable enough about the other possibilities","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}

{"text":"haha, me too, macy!","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"so...there must be people out there we do not know about who are desrving.","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i wouldn't worry about it - you shouldn't fret, haha","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"we all seem to be typical Americans, pretty uninvolved with international news","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"i know i am","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"... guess that leaves us out of being nominated :x","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"Aren't there separate prizes for science?","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}

{"text":"right- anyone in 2009 that was in the news for humanitraian relief internationally like she was?","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"the problem with seeger - is that although i may like him some and know some about his music, he didn't relate to a big enough cross-section of the population","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"oh definitely not david","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i agree","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah - i'd say Diana would be a good pick","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"i can only think of americans- i'm really bad at this-- there are certainly international people","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i'd say he deserves it - there's definitely no other American more deserving , that's even easier to conclude i think","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}

{"text":"I was really impressed by Sima Samar","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"yes - and the U.S. still creates a model that many struggling nations emulate, the U.S. still has influence, albeit it waning and declining - so to elect to an individual of African heritage, perhaps the most demonized and disadvantaged group in our national history, was really encouraging to the rest of the world - creating an incredible ripple effect","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}

{"text":"you're pro-Obama in this debate and have mostly cited the fact that he was elected","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"it looks like it's an annual prize, i have to eat my words on that - i was too lazy to check it up","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"is that your primary reason for thinking he deserves the prize?","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"or also because of his outreach to open international talks","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"good point","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}

{"text":"i hadn't signed in yet, my apologies","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yeah, a lot of years it is shared - which is often the case for other categories of the award","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"so - if he really doesn't deserve it - why do you think it was awarded to him? bc they don't have to bow to the U.S., that's for sure - i suppose this question strays from the topic, but to a certain extent i defer to their judgement and expertise","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"wondering which of what?","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"a) that he was elected (which is historically significant and awesome) or b) his engagement with the international community","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"david- my view on it is for \"hope\" and a \"possibility for big change\"","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"which are great reasons","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think the fact that he was elected, has opened up avenues for peace talks to begin, has initiated many bills (like for healthcare) in the US, and that he instilled hope in a population that was waning before he cam einto office all contributed","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i believe his presidency has effected the world tremendously, in social issues, but i believe the peace prize could have had a better candidate. who i am not sure. he has had a lot of great ideas about how to regulate and achieve peace. but at that point in time no progress was made. there has to be someone in the world who made more achievements then the few hopes obama had","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he truly is a magnanimous figure in the world, he himself gives peoplehope","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"what about nelson mandela (i'm drifting from the current chat)","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"oh, i'd say both actually - bc his engagement with the international community is very well documented - for example, his speech in Berlin had the most powerful nation in the EU believing they had an ally in the U.S. - and his gestures to the Muslim would could arguably had an impact on potential young Musliim fundamentalists -","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"extending the olive branch to this group, instead of ostracizing them really could have had profound impact on the overall stability of that volatile area","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"the talking tour he did was amazing","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think that's probably the reason he won","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I come back to the tangibility argument we had earlier","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"haha","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"however, i think that just the reactions to obama being elected seen around the world at the time were quite touching and did mark a new era in hope","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"not in those terms, that's a bit silly","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"well, when it comes down to it - i just think they know that they're doing and i'd trust them more than the average person i find on the street, including myself","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}

{"text":"sure - it could have been calculated - to hold him accountable and pull him into the international spotlight more - but they still bestowed this honor on him, and it would tarnish their reputation if they awarded it exclusively for this reason - with all the pride they have for their country, i don't think they would do this with what is at stake - although it could have been a factor","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"what presidents promise and what they do are two different categories","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"people wouldbt have a problem with obama being voted prize winner down the road bc they could look back and list the things he put into action (rather than just his precense)","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I hope so","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Exactly, this is why i'm still not 100% convinced he should have received it","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}

{"text":"he was a new comer.. it was too early","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah - proly not - but a lot of times there is disagreement, just maybe not as much - the other issue, is that people usually don't pay attention unless it's someone we all have heard of or can relate to - i mean how many people know who won the nobel prize previously?","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"true- maybe the committee wanted people to pay attention to him","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":":)","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"thats true david. i can;t honestly say i know much about many of the past recipients; i just let it go","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}

{"text":"oh definitely","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah- i like to see a list for a winner of a prize","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"like htis","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"i believe too much emphasis was placed on his race, rather then the efforts he made towards peace","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"list of achievements","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i dont think so - bc his achievements were listed - and i'd argue that race can't be over emphasized, bc it is so important, it's so determining","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"oh i dont look at it that way julie, but rather emphasis on possibilities he may offer the world with not only his race but his background and list of \"wants\" for the us and world","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i agree, but i feel that may have been one of the reasons he was even in consideration for the award.. especially so early in his presidency","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I disagree","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"yeah - of course it was a reason","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}

{"text":"i disagree","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"people around the world were touched by his election","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}

{"text":"he's an amazing, powerful speaker","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and a force for change","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"it shows how far america has come in history, what does that have to do with world peace","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"no - it has international consequences - to see someone ascend the social structure from such a poor, victimized segment of the population - all the way to the presidency - and talk about things like cooperation and working together, that sets a precedent for his presidency and gives other nations a reason to hope for the U.S.'s cooperation","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i wonder why they dont release nominees until 50 yrs later","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Obama was neither poor or victimized though","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}

{"text":"actually , he was very poor","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"he's no better a representative of that than I would be a representative of a homeless person","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"he was considered middle class growing up and went to Harvard","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"and how many black people do you know who are wealthy? not many - i mean the average income for a black individual is a joke compared to what it is for a white, that's just a fact","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"you can't argue that","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I'm not arguing racism","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I'm arguing Obama as an \"everyman\"","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"no president ever, as far I'm concerned, has been an \"everyman\"","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"his family didn't have any money - they basically had nothing, some intellect - but no money","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}

{"text":"or the time away from work","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"he wasn't poor","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"he had money all his life","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"hence his presidency","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"well - why don't you read a paragraph biography on the early life of our president - the guy was lower class, maybe lower middle class - that's a sharp contrast from any","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"other president i can think of , especially in modern history","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i do see him as differetn from past presidents- hence a feeling of hope for the country","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"economically-wise","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"anyone can do anything in this country","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"their family couldn't afford to send him to college - so that's quite a bit different than someone with blue blood who is just born and does nothing","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"if circumstance are allowing overall","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"can we focus on the peace prize","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"so his symbolism got him the prize- are we in agreement on this bit?","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"\"anyone can do anything in this country\" - that's the most naive statement i've heard in a long time","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"right - why don't we just go out and become VPs at bank of america","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I disagree with that macy","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"i wouldnt say that a certain individual is incapable of causing a change for him\/herself","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"i hate political debates, no one wins","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well, since we came to a standstill","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah - this is going to be tough if we have to come to some consensus - i mean, it's a divisive topic, that's the point and why it was selected -","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"tough topic","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"do we have to come to some conclusion? or can we just agree to disagree?","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"maybe we could talk about some of the other nominees","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah, we can do that","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I think we can agree to disagree at this point","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"consensus is an illusion most of the time anyway... there are always those in disagreement","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"mmhmm","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"good talk anyhow i suppose- made me think and rethink","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"lol","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"my opinion hasn't swayed; i still am not convinced, but i do think this is quite the interesting topic","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"im opinion is the same as well","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"right- i still have my same opinion as when i got here","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i don't think this chat worked out as planned","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well, I think the idea is more to study the dynamics of the chat","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i truly wish i wasmore knowledgeable and could at least nominate another person!","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"not for us to overthrow the Nobel committee","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"no final agreement- as with most political related topic as someone already mentioned","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"One of the links we were emailed listed some of the other nominees, shania","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"link","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"it proly did i think - bc they want to see how people communicate online, how some people are overbearing and strongly opinionated - or stubborn - or those who yield and are more easily persuaded - i wouldn't assume it's been a failure or a success","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"we pretty much followed the directions as far as i know","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yes i reviewed that but don't know enough about anyone to back them as a viable candidate","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"agreed, david","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i think we've had a good chat, i'm eager to see just how much obama gets \"done\" during his presidency and i hope for the best just like evryone else","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i need health insurance! haha!","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"same","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"oh, yeah - inrid bettencourt - a lot of personal and political courage to fight graft - her life was in the balance with drug cartels , yet she advocated for groups that were being exploited - she easily could have","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"just taken the bribes and kickbacks the cartels offered","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i could just make a comment about how people didnt like my earlier comment- i believe that if people dont think or behave positively, there is no chance for overcoming obstacles or challenges- i just like to believe that things are possible even if not at arms length.","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"wish the world was like that","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"what comment was that macy?","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":";) gotta try even if i dont see it happen","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"about my view on people can do anything","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yes, i agree - we can write our own destiny, be captain of our own fait - we have control, and this is an appealing idea - but with someone like Obama or nearly most people for that matter - you're limited by the place you are in society at the time of your birth, people usually don't climb much higher","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i have personal experience there- or witnessed rather- and it can be remarkable","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"fate *","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"your fate is yours","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"lol","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"i mean you can improve your lot and position , for sure - countless people do - but usually you're not going to go from middle to upper class and be able to touch all these lives","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i dont disagree, life is tough","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i agree david. while we try to think that we live in a classless society, we don't. it's much more difficult to increase your status when u start from the bottom","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I think our society has a few structures built in to try and level the playing field","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"change has occurred though, and its because the people achieved what most people believed to be impossible","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"although it's sort of like putting bandaids on a gushing wound","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"the underlying structure is still pretty hard to overcome","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"structure for sure- the foundation is difficult to change even if one or two are able","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yeah - there are deep structural factors","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"our society doesn't really enable equal opportunity for all, no matter the structures that are present","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"structural factors like poverty and inequality - but it reflects really well on the U.S. - that someone succeeded like this, and that it gave hope to immigrants and people looking for a more peaceful, prosperous, productive life coming to American soil","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i agree","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yes- public figures make differences","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"well - i mean this bettencourt lady worked to stop widespread corruption in south america -","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so this goes a long way in bringing about peace - whereas most other people succumb to the pressure and the threats on their life in this region of south america where mass killings and kidnappings are supposedly common place for anyone who opposes the cartels, although this could be sensationalized too - i dont really know for sure","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"she said she wants to become the president of Columbia","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"so maybe we'll be seeing more of her","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"hope so","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"it does show true integrity to oppose such powerful groups that could really murder you and get away with it. i hope we do here more about her","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"are we nominating her for the peace prize?","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"thanks for bringing up","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"yeah, hopefuly she stays alive too - i mean it proly sounds ridiculous - but it almost sounds like politicians like her are really targeted by the opposition and sometimes even assassinated bc they want to change things too much and stop the killings","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"makes sense","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"if killing is the tool of choice","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"oh yeah david. this isn't ridiculous at all, it happens all over the world and someone that rises up and stands against such power is powerful him\/herself","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"when someone stands in your way, or cries out too loud, you kill them","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"soo the chats almost coming to a end: so lets sum up","speaker":"julie","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"Obama:","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yeah - but on the other hand - courage isn't the only factor in determining the winner of the peace prize - she did face formidable opposition and threats on her life - but even after all this, she still has to have a measurable impact","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"all against, except 1 for","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"agreed david","speaker":"shania","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}

{"text":"okay. well, since it's just about 4:30, why don't we get started. we can go through these one by one or we can talk about the guys--the ones you guys have already read--in--from--from what we did online before. it's a little easier i think to go through them one by one, rule them out that way. but, i mean, it's up to you. anybody who has an input. feel free to jump in.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well, i only really saw one that didn't really seem to have much to offer on rosie mann. i didn't really see anything too impressive about her.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":" umm, she probably has charisma. it looks like she was--she played several leads, which would be good,","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"not the job itself.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i agree with like what she said about having theater experience.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" i think that adds charisma and creativity and i feel like the only other thing she really possessed that was an asset was computer skills","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":". but other than that, i don't think that she had much though to make her qualified.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"as far as resumes go, i like her qualification summary.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":" like the third bullet on employment isn't real specific, umm, in addition to like stress management media--meditation, umm, that could be helpful in any job setting probably. but it--it doesn't really describe how she's like certified in this area. how is this gonna contribute, i guess.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"umm.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"and then she was a writer for her yearbook, but i don't know if that really qualifies her to write...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"right.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"a, press releases.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" there's also no dates for the employment. so it could have been a very short period or the entire length of her...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"...her undergraduate career there,","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":" so. umm, strong gpa is--is a (attractive though).","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i believe she has the strongest of all the gpas yet","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"right.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" i mean, this one individual, like he did win a couple scholarships, but it doesn't say what his gpa is, so we really want to (get\/guess) mark (is that the ??).","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"uh huh.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"the governor's state scholarship","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"umm, we would have to kind of look those up to see what they--like the art competition, this does look for some creativity in a job, but like a studio art. that could be really...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well, it is a marketing campaign.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"right.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"which would involve making a...","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"(???\/kids.)","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...leaflets and stuff and that would, umm, require some artistic skills. that to me was one of the biggest things that he had.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and he also has experience with writing press releases","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"uh huh.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"that is big.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"that's definite plus.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah,","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" and he has au--a--a pretty good amount of--it's eight months of work experience and, umm, although he was an intern...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he still learned...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he wasn't like a student employee. so i don't know, it's kind of like almost professional...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"...experience, i like that.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"still learn a lot doing internships though.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"and he was a res hall--or resident assistant, so he knows how to manage things.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think it gives 'em interpersonal skills too.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"for dealing with that many people.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"definitely.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"just like with developing like the programs for his residents or whatever, you could say it would help with managing the special events for (???).","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" it doesn't list like html skills, but, umm, that's also not explicitly mentioned in the job description. and if we believe that he is truly a motivated self-starter with the hope could grasp issues that--that shouldn't really exclude him, umm...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"but on the other hand, sally, i guess she has definitely some--maintain office web site.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"uh huh.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"so that could be really for sure...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well...","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"but that's still like generally saying that she posted updated content...","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...it could just be that she like just plugs in like whatever people give her.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"so you don't really know what that means.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"considering that she has no experience and that the only skill that she's mentioning isn't like a high level skill, it's not very hard to keep a web site updated. especially with the software programs they have now. i think at least her compared to mark, i would say that she's not a strong candidate. umm..","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but...","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"... that she has no experience that's directly related to it really hurts her.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"to me, the biggest weakness in mark is he--he was a psychology major, which is a nontechical degree. so, umm, he has people skills, but that psych--umm, he could very well have no computer skills at all besides, umm, ???...","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah, but...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he could be io psych, which is industrial organizational.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah, on the other hand...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so it doesn't say what...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"this is--this is business administration. it's not, a, chemistry. i mean, i think the psychology degree's--say, for example, he wa--he was a 4.0 and he did, you know, all these social science things like--like we're doing here now. so, umm, because like this is such a inclusive list here, i feel like it meshes pretty well.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but, of course, he didn't list a gpa, which would imply it probably wasn't very high.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"that--i did...","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...notice that.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"it--it implies that, but we would be--we would be guessing there. we would be speculating for sure. just like where she doesn't--her web site, a, it's a pretty, i feel like a reasonable conclusion that to think that, since she doesn't--wasn't real specific. we're--we're talking about her web skills, if they're pretty minimal. a...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"on the other hand, they could be really sophisticated i guess too. umm, but likely she--i mean, i--i going back to your point about, umm, the gpa, but i don't really know how, a, like traditional that is to list your gpa. probably the closer you are, the more recent you are from graduating college, the more your gpa is on your resume, but.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"december 2009, you know, that was only two months ago, so.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but he also has scholarships listed an--more than one, as well as the dean's list two semesters. so i feel like that must correlate with something.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"umm.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"yeah,","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" if he's gotten the dean's list for two semesters that means he had to have at least a 3.5...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...for those two semesters.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" i mean, based on the information we have, it makes it difficult 'cause ideally we could just, a, ask 'em.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yes.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"well, i like something else that he had too, which was under the highlights of qualifications. and where it talks about maintaining a view of the big picture. i think that's something that is very important to just maintain control of a job that has a lot of tasks that are involved in it. so i like that a lot.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"but, of course, anyone can just say anything there. i mean, a lot of people just say whatever sounds good on those things. i mean, he doesn't really say what that means. he could just be a good writer and know what people wanna hear.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he could write that...","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"that's important to this job.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...that's a good skill.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" it's really good.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"and he, like--i--going back to the points of like the responsibilities, he's gotta, umm, manage the special events and does that with res hall stuff.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":" where, i mean, sally was a camp counselor, so it's like two different sides of the same coin.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. 'cause we are talking, umm, unless he'd like to quantify is good, because we get in a sense that sixty residents, that's quite a bit. and they have more, a, maybe like, that's more challenging maybe in a different way than--than children five to ten.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"uh huh.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"a little different needs.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but the other thing is, is that he's gonna be working --er, well, whoever we choose, is gonna be working with peers and, i mean, sally's working with children, whereas, mark's working with college age people.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"uh huh.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"so, i mean, he has to have some sort of--not just like the authority age, but like also like charisma to go along with the...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think that's a good point.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and sally only has html which prob--if she only lists that, that means she probably is not that sophis--sophisticated and, umm, that really isn't that hard to pick up html.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. ","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"so should we rule out sally? yes?","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"i say i.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yes.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"all right. who's next? jacob?","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":" jacob was my personal favorite. out of like all the other resumes, they seemed kind of bland to me, but i really like how he has all this a, this--all these people skills listed. i mean, what i got from just glancing over the job description was they want someone to really rep their company. they want them to be face...","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"...and this is like a young kid, he was in a fraternity, did all this, a, he--all this, a, like, a--a events and, umm, shows that he p--and so he was pretty much, a, the one i liked the best. and he had those computer skills.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"computer skills they asked for. whereas like, sorry, mark doesn't list, a, power point. i mean, which isn't really hard, but, i mean i think if they're asking for it, you should at least tell 'em that you know how to do it.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" i mean, this is word, word and excel for mark.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"it looks like he doesn't...","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...have maybe a lot of like professional experience, but what he did do, he like was very involved with.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"like he can pull, you know, things from cl--class and like school, umm, organizations.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and i don't know if i necessarily like his work experience compared to mark, because mark was managing people. whereas, jacob's a waiter slash host.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but he's..","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"it's not an easy job, but.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he did also just graduate, so you could say that he didn't have time to have a job maybe while he was at school, but he was very involved in school while he was there.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"so it kind a.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think the important thing here is that we're looking for someone who's going to be a team leader, not just on the team. and to jump in only having experience as a waiter works against him.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":" he--i--i really agree with jeremy that he does have the most effective resume,","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":" but i think he's also the only one who had a typo on it.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he had a typo?","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"and i'm nitpicky about that.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":" he did. umm...","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"oooh, where?","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"underneath the first section, objective, train and management staff.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":" it's little, but it's important and if this is his resume and he's got a typo on it...","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"oh, yeah, that's....","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"...is he gonna have typos on the press releases?","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"that would be a negative.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" that's not even grammat--go to lead and train and management. a...","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"team.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"that's does--it's not even grammatical, i don't think. train and manage staff, right?","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"it was probably just...","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"and train","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"...a miss click, ","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"but he didn't read over it before submitting it, which isn't very professional of him.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" that's too bad","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":" because i think he's actually a really strong candiate...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"...otherwise. umm, i mean, if it's...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i mean, he does list his gpa.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"it depends on how--how much this job will involve like, umm, working with, a, people for sure. and some of it is like behind the scenes though action. not all of it is, a, like a lot of it is a the press releases, the writing, the, a, internet and that type of...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but a...","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he's writing and he's got typo on his resume. i mean, how--what's.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but to me, they--i really like hi--i really liked his major. he's public relations...","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"oh, yeah.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"...marketing minor and communication. that to me was probably one of the strongest majors...","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"right.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"...for the job. i don't know how much involves business administration, how much communications, but i thought that was very strong.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" plus, his--the skills too here it's listed each of these points. you know, so, umm, otherwi--like if it weren't for--weren't for the a typo.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"umm.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"i think he'd be a really strong candidate for this particular job.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he seems strong, but not perfect. so maybe we could keep him as a maybe.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"and come back once we've gone through everything.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"all right.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"he also does the organizing for the special events. he did the talent show and the sales strategy for--or sales presentation strategy for his fraternity car show. so, i--i think those are both pluses.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"uh huh.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"uh huh.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"but, for example, i mean he raised four hundred dollars, which really isn't that much. so you don't really know how good he was at that. just that he attempted it.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"well, but that he does have experience with events, event planning or whatever. which is more than any of the other people do, so.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he also did the informal brochure, which is like part of the press release aspect of it.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"umm.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" you could also point out too that it depends who he raised the money from. if he was raising it from his fellow, a, peers, it's probably a lot of money. 'cause, umm.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"um--many students aren't really interested in contributing a whole lot. whereas, some people in the older demographic are...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"humpf.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"you know, that would be like a real pale in comparison, but this is, a, could be--maybe he's really talented at it, you know, umm.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think he did a lot ta, umm, supplement his formal education outside of just his classes and i think that that!\n  was a really good thing. that--i just from the advertising and the brochure, the raising money, organizing events, i just feel like he had--he sought out a lot in the fraternity too to, umm, to supplement everything that he was doing. it seems like he has a genuine interest in what he's doing.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"although, that did effect his schoolwork, because he has one of the lower gpas. he has a 3.3 versus 3.6, 3.8, which isn't...","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well, that's his end major gpa, but...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but overall 3.6...","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...his overall's a little higher.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well the end major's what we're concerned with though. we don't really care about what other classes he took...","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well, we don't...","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...you can't compare it to the other ones.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"plus, this isn't really a job i feel like that gpa is like really crucial unless it's like below three. umm, it's like a type of job where like...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"umm.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"...being really high in like a social...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"...(???) like working with people...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"right.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"that is like paramount. umm, gpa is...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i do think education's...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...is adequate.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...important though, because he's not gonna learn like, umpf, he's not gonna learn to just fix his typos if he's like got.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"right. for sure you need a, a, i think a bachelor's degree just 'cause it's so...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"...incredibly common, but, umm, umm, and accesible to most people in your--'cause in your--'cause assuming, fortunately, but. see the problem with a typo is that's such a, umm, our criticism is kinda of very, umm, it's not very substantive critism. it's like, you know, we're gonna--. umm, we assume, maybe, if you were to hire him that he was gonna be more careful on---on the press releases, but i--a.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah, but i mean, your resume's really important too. that's how you get your job.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"it is for sure.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"but i didn't even really notice it until she brought it up. i would if...","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i didn't either,","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" but now that i see it...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"it wouldn't...","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...it's glaring at me.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...be a huge deal, but considering that creating press releases is going to be a large part of his duties, umm, i would argue that you're more careful on your resume and your cover letter than you would be just doing the 99th of 100 tasks that you've been doing for the same company.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i think you'd be more careful when you really have something to lose if you don't do well compared to when you're comfortable and in your job and in the grind.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so why don't we keep both mark and jacob as...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"...like potential candidates. talk about pamela.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i thought she was okay.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i didn't like how her internship only lasted a few months, so it wasn't that much experience.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":" i mean, it was good what she did, how she presented product, that was really good experience,","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":" but it would have been nice if it was a little bit longer.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but not all internships are that long.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" it's looks like it's just a summer internship.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and it's very finance and accounting related too.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"a, it's not really marketing, ummm.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but she does present at the trade shows.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" that's what--that's why the--this was put in there i think to make it (???) yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"other than that, i don't see too many people--other people skills.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"definitely.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"and most likely treasurer, i don't know exactly what's involved in that job, but i'd assume there'd be some.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think it's one thing to deal with your peers, like kids your age.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":" but then when you--with jacob, where he's dealing with other people, not just students. i think it's different in my eyes.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" we're not, umm, i don't know, maybe we could say that like jacob learns quickly and he has--he has the html, which, umm, maybe you could say like is--is, a, easy to--to pick up,","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":" but for someone who has like very little interest in--in learning it, or who, a, struggles with that. i think it would be like pretty insurmountable obstacle, but possibly. umm, 'cause this is just like treasurer. this is just a very finance and accounting, umm, i mean, she might be like smarter than jacob, but she's not a !\n very good--as a better match. she's not a good--good of match for the job. i don't think.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i don't know. she's also, i mean, the dorm room assistant, like i think that's a good thing,","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":" 'cause we said that was good for mark too.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"it is good.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"so, i mean, that shows people skills and management skills, because you have to be able to like kind of organize things and keep people in line. so that's one side of it.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but she doesn't really seem to have the creative side at all.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. i was just gonna say that.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" i was kinda of hoping to see more like you could say you're an ra, but you can just sit in your room and like, a, deal with like academ--or, a, a, like judicial problems with your--with your, a, residents. but she didn't really, a, say that too much about like what programs they hosted.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"uh huh.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"or like what things they did in their common rooms or something. so ra, what--to what depth?","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"to me, the only thing that she has is that presented product at trade shows. that was a huge thing,","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":" but that was the only thing i saw that was impressive.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and even that--that could you could say that that's just like sales, which isn't really something that--i don't know.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"okay. everyone in favor of pamela say no.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":" i--i'm against her, so.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. take her out.\u2193","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"??? against her. all right. i said that all backwards, but. so it's jacob versus mark. da da da.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":" all right. let's go through the pluses of jacob and the minuses. he's got the typo. that's minus.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":" but he has a ba in communications.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"and public relations and marketing.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"and he has probably the most persuasive, umm, resume. he is directly, a, umm, addressing things that the job description does.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"which is just a persuasive writing technique and he's the only one really showing that and hitting every point.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. ","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"and he also lists his gpa, which is a big thing for me.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"umm, i would say he seems to be really motivated, umm, just from the amount of stuff that he's done and, umm, earning 50 percent of educational expenses. it just seems like he, i don't know, is motivated...","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so it's a plus?","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"it means he probably could have even done better if he didn't have--if he wasn't working all the time.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"right.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" it seems like he's handling a lot.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but his work experience is only in the summers.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"and i--i personally--i personally like wait staff because, umm, that mean--and--and hosts, because this means he's working with people. he's interacting with and people, talking to them.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and it's stressful.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"absolutely. it's tough, so.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah. i mean, the problem with that too is--is we see--or we focus on--only on jacob right now, 'cause we see like comparable, a...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"skills with mark.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i mean, we can go both, back and forth.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and he also has photoshop too.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah,","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" that was big.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"uh huh.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"but, of course, it depends how good he is in photoshop, so.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. i don't know, i don't think the wait staff is really on his side, though.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"what, that he didn't like, project himself more into taking a better job? or a think about that.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"well, he doesn't have the management experience that mark has. he doesn't have--and in terms of management, i mean like managing...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"management.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...people.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"okay.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"i mean, he's got the management training. but that's really i mean, he's got manangement training by organizing a talent show. i don't know if that's really--that's a plus for the special events, but not--he doesn't..","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well, i think it depends on what the talent show is. like if it was a talent show in like a dorm, i think that's one thing. and if it was like a talent show that was in the pack, and he organized like a big, like, you know, like gala surrounding it or something. i could go either way i feel like too.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he says it's for the semester at sea.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. we know for sure he has...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...like power point skills.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"like with the html skills, isn't say what he used them for as like, but still his computer skills are a little, umm, deeper","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":" maybe more than--than mark.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. the two hardest things to pick up, i would say, would probably be photoshop and maybe power point and, umm, he's got 'em","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":" and mark doesn't really.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"word and excel are really easy.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think i disagree with that,","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":" because i think photoshop is...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah, i actually really disagree with that.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"...is quite, a, like simple in comparison to, a, html, which is really dynamic and allows for incredible range of abilities.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"umm.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"'cause you can have like really good web pages...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but he has...","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"all the way down to, a...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"plus, there's...","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he has both of them, though.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i guess it depends how good you are.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"just mark that doesn't (???) it.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"there's online guides for like all of this stuff. so there's easy access to web ???)...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"oh, yeah, for sure...","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"if you don't have it already. and that's like the one thing that makes me like wonder if ...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah, but like photoshop for me is not like the tipping point. i mean, umm, i would expect that mark with the intellect he has here, could easily conquer photoshop with html for certain that's yeah. it's just we don't know, but for photoshop we can be certain he--he knows photoshop.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but mark's...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...it seems like mark has more writing experience.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but he also has the...","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"right. yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" mark has--has...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"humpf.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"...superior writing experience.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"uh huh.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"i think definitely. yeah. i mean, it would be--'cause that's eight months, that internship, umm, it'd be nice if--if he like was, you know, quantified that was more specific with these speeches. umm, how many of them did he proofread and edit versus how many did he like author himself. umm...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"you know, but, umm, for sure i think he's--he has better writing skills, but see part of this job too is like presentation skills and like, you know, what the--whatta--i guess i don't know with the type--typo or not, but. yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well, do we wanna go over the pluses of mark also, like again? i don't know. i don't know what--there's a b--or weigh them against each other. you guys tell me.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"well, umm, just a side point. well, we've kind of put them on an even basis in terms of g--gpa being that jacob is kind of like, you know, okay and mark doesn't list anything besides a couple of awards. ","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"could we kind of put that on like a...","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"yeah. that seems fair.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"sort of tends to level out.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"a...","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"sorry. go ahead.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"and, of course, umm, since jacob earned fifty percent of his education, means he was working and going to college. which means he probably could have done a lot better in college (???)...)","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"since he only...","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but it's always ...","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but it's over (???) the summer...","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...the summer, yeah.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"mark was working during the year","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":" and jacob was only working during the summers.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"oh, yeah.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"well, mark was only an ra during the year, i mean.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah, but an ra's not easy.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah, but it like works around your school schedule, 'cause it's through the school.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"yeah, but it doesn't mean that you don't have ta'--i mean, if--if--if all jacob is doing is working over the summers and participating in his frat stuff. i think that's like the same sort of thing.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah, but...","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but i think that being an ra you have to manage more things. you have to...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well,","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"... you have to be accountable for your residents and you have to like hold certain events.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he might have to with fr--fraternity also.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"to me it boils down to, a, jacob--they both have a good amount of experience. jacob seems to have like a more social experience. while mark's...","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"uh huh.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"...a experience is more formal. he has that, a, a good internship and, a, the ra. i like how he elaborated on that. programs, advice, 60 residents, that's impressive. so...","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. at this point, i think actually i--i could be convinced, but i'm sort of leaning towards mark...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"...because...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i'd agree.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"the job description does for sure emphasize like these, a, people skills that we keep talking about. but a lot of it is, a, the writing and, a...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well, why don't we go...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"...back through the job description, 'cause that'll probably give us our answer.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"yeah. i.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"so, like they want motivated team player. i mean, they're both motivated and they both have people skills. and they want a bachelor's degree in one of the related fields. and mark doesn't have a bachelor's degree in business, or journalism, or commu!\n nication, but it's in psych. which is a good thing or a bad thing depending on where he focused in.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think that's fine supplemented by his professional experience.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think so too.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i mean, if they're gonna develop and implement strategies, we see that with mark's more than we see it with jacob's, because mark has to like write, proof, and edit these speeches and press releases, so.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. on that particular point, he has an edge i think over jacob.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"but then jacob also has the, he has the brochure for an apartment leasing company and for, a, presentation for the school.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah, but we...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so he does have some.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"kind of less formal level...","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"...i guess.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"uh huh.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"yeah, okay.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i mean, the thing about the res hall that goes with this also is that, like, you have to design content for internal and external like media. whether it be web sites or like the programs that he's putting out. like the information!\n  that he's providing. and he (???) with information for his residents. so i feel like that's both an internal and external thing. as--like in--in his job, too.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"wait, what did you say?","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Signal-Non-Understanding"}
{"text":"it says they will support the (???) goals of the organization by designing content for internal and external web sites and social media.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"right.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"so i think that mark's experience lends itself more to internal and external interactions than jacob's does.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"right. yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" like service liaison between residents and student affairs administration.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"so he was advocating for...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"both sides.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...residents probably. and, but also listening to what they say, you know. yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"plus, i mean, if he's working, or if he worked with that management intern, then he was working with other people in his office to put forth these press releases and speeches.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i'm looking at the, a, the bullets under responsibilities, include, but are not limited to. a, the, a, four little stars there, i think, a, mark takes it on the first three","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":" and jacob may have an advantage on the last one.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":" although, mark doesn't really tout his, a, social abilities or, kind of a downfall just looking at paper instead of interviewing 'em. but, a, i think, a, mark kinda takes it there.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i mean, if this was a real short list, we could interview both of them, but...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"there you go.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i don--i think they both would be good for the job.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"oh, yeah, absolutely.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" i think they have--both have their pros and cons, but when it comes down to one.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"we still got another hour, so we--we can keep talking about this.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"okay.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"sorry, what were you gonna say?","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"umm, with jacob, i just noticed a kind of weird discrepancy, there, umm, i mean, not just the typo, this is a little bit less picky than that. umm, under management training, organizational ability. he says that he performed restaurant duties ranging from busboy to night mananger.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"if he has official management experience, why didn't he list that in his work experience?","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"umm.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"that's a strange, umm, typo. it makes me wonder, was he officially a mananger ever or did he jump in one night when the manager was sick...","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.|","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"...and vomiting in the bathroom.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"maybe it was 'cause it was night he didn't really do that much. so he didn't really consider it.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"uh huh.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"and maybe that speaks on his char..","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but...","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...on his part then for not putting it.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...if he had management experience and this is management, he would be listing that under work experience even if it was like two months. he just wouldn't put dates. he would put mananger.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"right.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"probably something he did occasionally when the manager was sick or something like that. they would just assign him the job temporarily.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"umm.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"even with that, that's...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. i mean, i don't think he's trying to be like deceptive. umm, i don't think he was an official manager, i think is basically what that says, like.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"uh huh.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"it very clearly says like, it very clearly states that he performed duties ranging from that. so, likely when the night manager had the night off or was sick he would, a, kind of substitute and learn some of those duties. but, umm, he didn't have the official title.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"that's something he still could have listed under actual work experience, though. umm, whether you see that as being deceptive, or whether it's just not persuasive writing, or not organized writing. the way he put that together was a very poor choice considering how small his work experience is.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"umm, but i mean, he's not a night manager, so if he were to put it under work experience that would be, a, over--that would be embellishing and like, this, a, characterizing is--is a work experience. so, i--i mean, i think it's appropriate there.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"umm.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"yeah. like i don't see that as a very a--as a--i don't see it as significant, basically.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think that jacob is kind of a gamble in the sense that i feel like he has the potential to grow and flourish in the job, but i don't think that he has enough professional experience to really make that a sure thing.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"whereas, i feel like with mark he has professional experience and i feel like he would kind of, umm, perform what was needed. but i have less confidence that he might flourish. does that make sense?","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yeah. 'cause jacob kind of went out of his way, ta' you know, it wasn't his job--like he didn't need to do these extra activities while he was at school.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"umm.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"so.","speaker":"moderator","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"if this was a real situation. i think jacob's really promising, and mark's really promising. i would never hiether--hire either one of them as a manager. when one has one internship under his belt and one has been a waiter...","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well, (???) not for a...","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"...during the summer.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...management position.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"umm, it's the specialist who lead the team, isn't it?","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"umm.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"yeah, but we can't...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"that's what i read.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...really umm, we have to hire the people that apply.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"right. we have to hire...","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"...one of these people.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" in real life i wouldn't.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"mark, because of what (???) just said.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"actually, she made a good point, that seems like makes sense too is that, umm, yeah, for sure, like, there's less risk involved with, a, mark. like there's really evidence that, a, he had the, a, professional experience, umm, for, eight months.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and, umm, i think, a, yeah. i think, umm, with jacob, umm, yeah. you cou--it could go, a, either way if you hire him even.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"sometell--somehow i got, i don't know if this really applies or not. but i got a feeling that jacob's a guy who likes to party a lot, go out and drink and stuff, well, not so much with mark. some, just--yeah.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"no, i got that feeling too. he's--","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah, for sure.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i mean, if he's in a frat, i mean.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well, and not to characterize...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well, it's--","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...all frat boys...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"it's a professional (???).","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...(???) a certain way.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...professional frat...","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...it's completely different.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...it's not a social frat.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"a, my ex-roommates were in professional frat...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. i'm just saying, though, like it's not like a frat boy...","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"no, no. i know, but they were in a professional frat and they did the same sort of thing, sort of things as a...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"yeah, i--i mean, social...","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...social frat did.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i'm in that frat, so, not yet.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well, i'm not saying anything bad about it.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"no. no. i'm saying there--there definitely is drinking involved, but just not--it's not like a social frat. like that's, yeah.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"well, i think to go along with that, i think that could be considered a good thing too. because i think this job definitely calls for someone who is extroverted. they have to organize and manage events. they have to do all these things that, umm--well i guess i'm sort of...","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah, it says right here...","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"umm.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"...special events and parties.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"parties.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...difficult task, because you want someone who's really agressive socially, i think for this job. on the other hand, umm, i keep looking at the job description and thinking that it's not quite as like, umm, emphasizing, umm, like the social aspects as, a, as would be a perfect ma--it's--it's like still a better match for mark because of the presentation. a, the written skills, umm.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but mark's got the social aspect too 'cause...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and the same--and also when you're making a resume you don't try and make it look like you're social, you know.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"so.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"humpf.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"but he says that he developed programs for like he--he--the programs are--are not just like, umm, they can be social events...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"uh huh.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"...too.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"that's true.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"so that's the other thing. it's like.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. just say manage special events such as sponserships, parties, introducing new products, or relationships, umm, to gain public attention. so you do want someone who will like promote, umm.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"the product?","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"yeah. yeah. so you really want someone really, a, extroverted, but still likeable.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"not like conceited, of course, or not like, umm, (???).","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so equal parts like hypeman and part like manager too.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well... i'm sorry,","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"go ahead.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"well, i pretty much, i said this before, i just feel like jacob has the potential to totally grow into this position. i--and he also has the potential to end up not being great at all, because he has nothing professional to really back it.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but i think that mark, umm, has the ability right now to handle it.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well, to me this, umm, this is kind of deciding factor. i know maybe a little superficial, 'cause you really can't tell this from a resume. but when i read these two, a, mark see--mark seems like a friendly face to for--per--a--portray the company with.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"umm, jacob seems like a go-getter, which may either be a good thing or a bad thing depend---depending how you wanna port--portray the company.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"right. 'cause this is just designed to see how we interact together, just because like to--to get inside into our decision making. just 'cause like this wouldn't probably never, a, 'cause this is when you--we wanna call the references and ask.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"umm, yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"about what, how's...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"...mark. umm, and meet the--i mean, i guess this goes without saying, but, umm, yeah, to be clear--i don't know, i feel like it is still important to state that you would never, a, hire someone like this when--for the cost of nothing, you could easily just meet them and call their employers. umm, but, so it makes it really...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well, let's just pretend...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...difficult.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...they're on a, on a unreachable island somewhere...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"we can't call them. i--a--i--a really--i think jacob would be an o--a better candidate if mark wasn't sitting right next to 'em. i don't know.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"uh huh.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"yeah, but his summary of qualifications is nice, too. umm, you know, creative, resourceful, and flexible, able to adapt to changing priorities and maintain a positive attitude and strong work ethics. so you can see how that fits into the will it be required in this setting here at the growing e-commerce company. motivated team player, someone who can roll with punches at that,","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":" umm, whereas jacob doesn't have the--he doesn't even have like a--a few sentences, like a couple...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"uh huh.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"i mean, these aren't sentences either, but...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i know that...","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"???\/sorry.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"sor-- i'm sorry i keep interrupting people.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"i know that you had said before that like anyone could say anything they wanted to in the highlights and qualifications, but i think that the fact that he knew that over jacob makes him more of a professional to even add that.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. 'cause he picked out these things from this job description and that's what he chose to highlight or tailor for this particular, a, resume that he submitted.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" and it's not even in grammatical, you know, his objective. so, i think this is more like a generic thing and this was specially written for the, umm, job.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"uh huh. yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"humpf.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i don't know. i don't think.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. clearly with this like he--he cared, 'cause he read the job description and.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"and he tailored his application...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"...to the job.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"umm, which shows like a high le--shows some interest compared to a...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"...media relations executive is not--that takes a lifetime probably to...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"...achieve. (???).","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and he probably should have said like something like my goal is to lead or something. just go to lead and train management staff, i don't--just doesn't sound grammatical.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. well, i mean, as a bullet point it's not terrible, but i think he should have used maybe just--just at least reread it or read it aloud to himself one--once more before submitting it. goal to lead and train and management staff.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"right. 'cause it says some of the responsibilities are write interesting and effective press releases and prepare information for ads and\/or media kits.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"so we have to be nitpicky, because this is what his job would be.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"is to create...","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"...convincing documents.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"his document is convincing and i think in some ways it's more convincing than mark's. i like the way it's laid out. i like how he specifically picked out the different skills that are relevant to the position.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"umm, in other ways, some of it's weird. some of it's sloppy, he has a typo.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. well, on that side of it, i mean, he's got--we're gonna be super nitpicky, under his skills like the third hi--like line he's got everything tabbed over in the lines before, the second part of it is not in line. you know, it just looks a little messy to me. and if you're gonna be creating a press releases, then i think you might want it to look a little neater.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well, personally, i think both resumes are hideous looking. but i think jacob's is worse. jacob's to me looks like an email.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. it's--it's a little bit busy i think for sure.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"uh huh.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"like with the education, i mean.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and he had the room to like space it out more...","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"uh huh.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"...and make it look better.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but i think mark's was also a lot simpler. i mean, it--it didn't show that he, umm, really knew how to use all the word processing software very much, but...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"...but jacob showed that he, umm, had a better comprehension of word processing software, even though it wasn't perfect.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but just that he had like a header type thing.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"umm.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"just even that.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"one thing that i--keeps jumping out at me from jacob's, is under the communications language tab, the last part there. traveled around the world with semester at cnu's, conversational and communications skills to interact with local area natives. one, it's redundant, conversational and communication skills, because when he was \"communicating wi!\n th the natives\"...","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...only part of it was conversation, the rest of it was, a, sign language he made up on the spot.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"to interact with them.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. we've local as opposed to distant area natives. so, i don't even know why he...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"plus natives.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...put local.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"like.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"no, it's probably appropriate, i guess, 'cause.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i don't know i think...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"they were from the (???).","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think the language is offensive.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well, i think that what that serves as is, a, an interesting like talking and conversational point. and, but i think that it also goes along with sort of his brand as this extroverted, umm...","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"partier.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"exactly.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"guy.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think it's--it's good because it shows that he can communicate with people from other cultures and that's a very good thing in advertising.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":" but the way he wrote it, it was so ineffective and...","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"...almost offensive in a way.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. this is like...","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"he's--he's proving and disprov--he's proving and disproving his point in that...","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...sentence.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" this is, umm, like heavy on image and like more, a, this attempts to be like really emphasize like flash more than this is, a, very substantive and, umm, the job description says, you know, excellent verbal and written skills. a, strong creative--strong writing skills basically.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah. umm, i don't know, i think the fact that mark has all these scholarships. i mean, he doesn't have his gpa listed, which is definitely.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he's very understated.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"he's--he's, a, not as concerned about, a, appearance, which, umm, which could be sort of, a, difficult for this job, but...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"uh huh.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"...umm,","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but he does have...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think that's fine in it...","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...creativity aspect in the hallmark award competition.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"the art competition.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"right. yeah, that's true.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i also like that mark's, umm, it was--it was simpler to read. umm.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. it's not as busy.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah. well, laid out.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"and honestly, something as simple as layout is a skill that they need to have for this job.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"uh huh.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"whether it's designing an ad, a web site or something else.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. jacob is saying that he has like created these brochures and this presentation, but like he can't put together a resume. so.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think that if we were going to call them in, we would probably need to have a small portfolio with both of them to see what...","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"umm.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"...sort of...","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"absolutely.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"...related documents...","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"uh huh.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"...can you provide.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"and look at it that way.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i--i think mark's a better writer this--but he might be a little, umm, slightly too introverted. although, it's impossible to tell from this. or he might be the nice guy you wanna portray your company as. it depends, like, what--ho--what you wanna portray your company as. ","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"if you want the, umm, if you want the go-getter, we're gonna (???), make as much money as possible, whatever, jacob would be the guy. ","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and mark would be the guy if you just wanna--wanna portray your company as someone very nice.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. i mean, jacob has like a lot of hustle for sure. it's just very aggressive. he earned 50 percent of educational expenses. umm, he's, a, seems real persistent, a, with people, you know, i think. umm, so he'd be like charming and, a, persuasive, but this isn't sales as much as it is, a, writing press releases, presentations, so. umm.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"that's the other thing that i--like it's kind of good that you can't meet these people for a fake job. because jacob might come in here and be like all charming and like, no, i'll--i'll be super good at this job. and mark might be a little shier, but he might be the better candidate, because of his work experience and hi!\n s training.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"a, mark's a safer bet from just looking at these two.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i completely agree.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"he hasn't thrown all the parties, which is one thing that we do want for this job. he's supposed to manage special events and parties.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"that is part of it, but at the same time, we don't feel like he's just going to totally drop the ball like jacob might.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"plus, the parties, i mean, they're not supposed to be like crazy keggers.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"it's not like crazy parties.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"right.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"but that social skill of walking around the room and making sure everybody, that you say hi to everybody, have you heard about our new product? i feel like jacob could probably do that from, just from his description of talking to the natives.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think we're all in agreed...","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah, but i mean, how many natives from albany, new york? i'm not that--that--umm, let's not focus on it.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"the terminology.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"what?","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"no. no. go ahead. i'd like to hear.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"yeah. i don't ev--even think mark is middle of the--of the road in terms of the resumes we've got. i think he's the--basically the best compared to the resumes we've (???).","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"oh, yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"just intuitively he was the one that i marked as number one resume.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"me too.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"humm, i don't know, i think the rest of them had parts of it. and it seems like mark and jacob have it all, but in differing degrees.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"right. i--i wasn't comparing him to a list of all the other candidates, i was just looking at, as far as our...","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"like the (???) candidate.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...characteristics for the ideal candidate...","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"...with the job description.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think mark's the guy.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i vote for mark.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think we're all agreed.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah. i like mark. he has his core skills there, the professionalism.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"he does.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"and if you strip away like the social stuff, 'cause you can't really judge that. i mean, you can really say anything. or i mean on--in their resumes, when you take away, a, what they say about their social skills, when you--you have that, the core skills that they built in their undergrad. i like what i see with mark.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and you can learn the other computer skills that he doesn't necessarily have.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. we don't even know the level of the computer skills that, a, jacob has.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think a bachelor's degree qualifies you to really learn something as basic as a computer skill. so, i don't think that's that big of a issue.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. i mean, plus, for the required skills, they're all things he basically already knows for required skills.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah, and it's just, when they talk about content for the web sites. like they say designing content, not like actually designing the web site. it's just the content, so.","speaker":"rebecca","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"that's a good point, yeah.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"and they only say word, power point, excel. so if you really--if you take out html, i mean, the web site's probably gonna be there and they probably already have the infrastructure of the web site. so you're just gonna be updating with text. you can see mark has the better writing skills. they both know microsoft word. so, then it wo!\n rks better.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and he's got the artistic skills too.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah, the award.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"umm, umm, actually, i think the, let me go get thomas.","speaker":"moderator","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"okay.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"from what i hear, if this was a real meeting, it probably woulda been over in like ten minutes.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah, in a way, yeah.","speaker":"caroline","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"exactly. it was shoo, shoo.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"so, if one word they don't like they just throw it away.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think there's a lot of resumes being thrown away right now.","speaker":"vicky","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. i don't know, i kind of liked sally's, just 'cause she's the massage therapist. so she's gotta have the people skills for massage therapist.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah. she was my number two, between her and mark. okay.","speaker":"barney","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"really?","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"coulda been much worse. these--these jobs, i mean, i mean, some of the resumes that we had for the other jobs that we were deciding on online, that was during the last session, they're like really hard to choose because the canidates were like so closely matched.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"humm.","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"that it was just like--like one person didn't like it because of, like something really ridiculous and the other person didn't like him because he was a boy or something like that. really random things to argue over. glad we all agreed.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"how long did that take?","speaker":"jeremy","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"makes life a lot easier.","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"though*","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"we need someone real, because being an RA is not like dealing with public speaking or business deals","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"this guy seems to business suit, cut and dry","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"nothing tells me he could deal with everyday life, like if a student got drunk really bad and needed to talk to someone in the morning","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i dont agree with ariel","speaker":"ted","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}

{"text":"maybe her GPA isnt that string","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"strong*","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"for college","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i dont think thats that important","speaker":"judith","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}

{"text":"it's not really, except that there is a minimum required","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"which is what is said is required","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"she seemed to be very involved in activities during high school, but not as much during college","speaker":"ted","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"i actually liked that","speaker":"judith","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"agrreed","speaker":"ted","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"it showed confidence","speaker":"judith","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"me too","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"and not like he was just desperate to save money","speaker":"judith","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"true!","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"what didn't you like about evan, melany?","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"wow judith i had never even thought about that","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"umm i think i would actually keep evan now that im looking @ his resume again","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"spanish proficiency is good","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"but he wants free room and board at the most expensive dorm on campus, and ONLY there","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"yes, i liked the spanish proficiency too","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"and cpr experience","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah he obviously has alterior motives","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yea but that means he has enough confidence to get that room","speaker":"judith","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"and his resume isnt some cut and paste document he sends out everywhere","speaker":"judith","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"soo is there one person we could drop?","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"he tailored it for the position which i like","speaker":"judith","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"which is what i dont like","speaker":"ted","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"about rich ddadys boy ryan","speaker":"ted","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i think, luke, that we agreed to drop jade","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i think thats a smart move...if you send out the same resume to everyone u didnt take the time to think about the position","speaker":"judith","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"yeah but the fact that he has enough confidence and a voice to state his mind means he would do the same as an RA","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"ookk thanks","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"but is the position specifically for empire?","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"i dont believe so","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"no its not","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"he's choosing that himself, and in my opinion, he's taking his own liberties","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"but btw its not free for him to live on campus because he is an RA btw","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"its just a discount essentially","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes, i do realize that, but he wouldn't have to pay a very expensive room and board","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"anyway you cut it empire is expensive","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i dont care discount or not","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeaa it is","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"true","speaker":"judith","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i definatly dont have the money for it","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i dont agree, yes he took a liberty but he also too an action","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"neither does ryan","speaker":"ted","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"which is why if you could live there for free (or at a greatly reduced discount), it would be great.  i agree with melany, it's an ulterior motive. at least he's being honest about it, htough","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"which is more then i can say for most people who just walk past things that happen in the dorms","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"i like the confidence","speaker":"judith","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah at least hes being honest and straighforward","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"me too","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"besides whos to say if offered he wouldnt decide to take one of the other postitions","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"which is why i feel comfortable being straightforward in taking him out of consideration","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeaa i guess u really never know","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"people aply for one job all the time and get hired by the same people to do something else","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"maybe he thought u had to be specific","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"what other positions you are talking about\/","speaker":"ted","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"like if he thought u had to be specific as melany said","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"and yet was given a different spot then he choose","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"but that means he didn't read the job description very carefully","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"he had something in mid","speaker":"ted","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"mind sorry","speaker":"ted","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"hmmm what a predicament","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"its difficult to pinpoint what his intentions are","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he wanted empire specificallly","speaker":"ted","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so you think he didnt read the job discription? what if he was just taking a liberty? and he did read it well","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"i mean hell suny needs to have RA's for everywhere","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but then why would he specify? that's narrowing him down to the search committee","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"i dont see why taking him based on empire is a bad choice","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think that we need to just base it off their qualifications because we could talk about his intentions all we want to but we are never really going to know what it was based upon...","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but why is it a good choice?","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"because i think he speaks his mind","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"we ar trying to eliminate people and he is the next on my list","speaker":"ted","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and i think that's the best for an RA","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"not always","speaker":"ted","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"i don't agree that speaking your mind is best for an ra. you need to listen as an ra, not dictate","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"i think u need both","speaker":"judith","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"sure this is true but i think his listening skills are implied from the other things on his resume","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}

{"text":"luke, would you mind joining Group A actually.","speaker":"moderator","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"i'm \"leading\" - this takes more effort - okay, lets get started - i'll give this a shot","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"There's one person less there right now, we need at least four in a group. :-)","speaker":"moderator","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"you've noticed five categories to divide tax dollar resources","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"okkk","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"YEAH","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"woops","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"one option is to make it simple, and allot an even 20% of funds to each - does anyone feel this is a good idea?","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"or do you think some of these services are more important than others?","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I'm a librarian so ...","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"don't be shy","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i thought of the 20 percent right away","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i'm a librarian too","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I feel like its more important to give some more to other things","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"so i guess i;ll declare myself biased in that sense","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah were probably supposed to do different percentages","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"water and sewer probably need more things","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i don't think so, only because i think some things require many more resources than others","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"as meg said","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"So ... :-) 90% to the library, right?","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"meg - what do you feel should be short changed compared to others - and what examples -","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"make it 99% :-D","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"LOL - not really, we have to get to work on roads and use toilets","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"unfortunately I thing that the library needs less resources","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"yeah two important aspects","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Because they can always use independent donations","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"senior citizen services are crucial, yet they don't compose even 20% of the population in a typical town\/city","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"agreed","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"all of these services can rely on independent donations","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"true","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"what items could use more federal dollars?","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I'd say that road, water\/sewers and the refuse need the most money","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Philanthropists will take care of the seniors","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"haha","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"this is really related to city council distribution of funds, federal funds and grants are a different matter","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"they'd probably take care of the libraries","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i agree","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"seniors typically have the most resources and are better able to take care of themselves, financially at least, than any other segment of the population","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i know, but what i'm saying is that some fed grants may be very easy to get, and if you get money via fed dollars,","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"you could use less city dollars","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"seniors are the most powerful group - so lets give them say, 10% of the funds, max","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"If you take a look at how much of my household income goes to water\/sewer, refuse, and recycling it is really small ... I mean what the city charges us","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"good idea david","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"does anyone think that is too much?","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I think itd be easier if we knew houw much the budget was","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"I think its alright","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"yes, dont a lot of municipalities also have their residents use a private firm for recycling and trash disposition?","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"yes, knowing a figure for the budget would make this easier -","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"it's one thing to know how these stand in relation to each other, percentages - but the actual figure would be more helpful","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i would vote for a slighly higher amount for senior services","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"why?","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"maybe 12-15%","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"We have the option of private or city ... for city garbage we actually purchase blue city bags at the grocery store that your trash has to go in","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"small ones are 2:75 and large are 3.50","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"because i would put the lowest allocation to refuse and recycling","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"$2.75 and $3.50","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"senior services requires a lot more personnel i think","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yeah - there are often both options and residents have choice, or maybe a hybrid option","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"hmm","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"yeah - seniors really need no more than 10% , even that would be generous","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah, but its a lower pecentage of the population","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"i dont think they do","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"how much of the community uses the library? i'd say","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"a lot bigger percentage than there are of just seniors alone","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"i agree","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i think the library could be benefited more than the seniors","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"but seniors are more likely to have health issues, and that gets expensive, requires more personnel","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"aka needs more funds","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"thats true","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"why devote all these resources to one, small segment of the populatiion, who are so wealthy in comparison?","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"good poit","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"who agrees that the libraries don't need as much?","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"point*","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"health issues? they have Medicare","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"Lets approach this in a different way ... let's say each gets 20% and then decide if we take 5% away from one who do we give it to","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"are seniors wealthy?","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Thats a good idea","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"thats a good plan","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"many seniors are not wealthy","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"no, they are not wealthy","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"my parents have medicare and it pays for practically nothing","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"they are wealthy in comparison to everyone else in the population","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"So if Refuse and Recycling only needs 10% where should we spend that 10%","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"they have the most years of income, the most education, and pensions - they are the most powerful group in the United States today","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i'm not sure i agree with that, i would think it's more the 40-50 age range that are wealthier","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"i think highway and roads are important","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well - they have pensions and employment to pay for their health insurabce","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I know so many poor seniors on fixed incomes - it's really sad","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"me too","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"even if medicare pays for nothing, it's better than having no govt. health insurance, which the rest of the population has","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I feel like there are other public services that should be on this list that are not","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"agreed, but i still think they would have more potential health problems","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"perhaps those services are already determined","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"the resources","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"perhaps","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"if everyone had to pick one as the most important, what would u pick?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"so - maybe public libraries - we can fix that at 40% - who disagrees?","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":",,,..\/\/","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"public libraries is most important","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":" - what is everyone else's vote","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"please voice your vote","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"sorry","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"hmmm sorry still deciding","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"My computer freaked for a minute","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"Libraries can work consortially to cut costs","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think sewer and water are more important, even though i love libraries","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i think so too lynn","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"there can be alot of issues with sewer and water","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I agree with melany","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"very expensive issues haha","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I have a big house and get a sewer and water bill every three months that only costs like $120 - I don't think sewer and water require that much $ or our bill would be higher","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"we dont even have the population of this town\/city","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so it makes it more difficult, the lack of info.","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"thats a good point david","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"but every single person uses them, not every single person uses libraries or senior services","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"yes a necessity","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"its true","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Everyone should use the library :-)","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"- every person may use water and sewer, but those costs are also dispersed - and different municipalities share these costs - nyc gets it water from an aquafur - and","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"upstate ny gets it from underground as well as reservoirs, which are all shared by many towns and cities","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"we've certainly got time to debate! haha","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Is this what you are saying? Seniors 5%, Refuse and Recycling 8%, Libraries 12%, Water and Sewer 37.5%, and Highway and Roads 37.5 %","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"i'd be more likely to agree to that","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so you're spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on roads? instead of on education and culture , accessible through the library to the widest group of people?","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"a water sewage treatment plant, more than one water storage tanks, a purification plant","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}

{"text":"how many libraries are we talking about??","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"no not roads","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"let's spend 100% on military and defense","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Or Seniors 5%, Refuse and Recycling 8%, Libraries 27%, Water and Sewer 35%, and Highway and Roads 35%","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I got confused","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"haha","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"the schools are surely responsible for some oft he education and culture","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah, some","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"no need to be sarcastic","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i work in the arts, for a non=profit, a big believer in the arts","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I like that","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"what would happen if you went to fairfield, CT or north jersey, or any affluent place - and u took away their community library - they'd be mad -- but this is actually universal -- all towns devote a good percentage to libraries -","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"this is a tricky plan to devise","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"with so little information","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i'm just saying that if the water treatment plants, etc. aren't properly maintained, you have some serious problems on your hand and some serious fallout","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"if a library had problems, the community could get by until a solution was found, it wouldn't have health implications, etc","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and that would affect everyone, even those that dont use a library","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i volunteer at a library and know that volunteers are a big part of that system","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and somebody else mentioned earlier that they can easily work with other libraries, share resources. they are linked to other regional libraries","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"So what are we deciding","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"that makes it more expensive, to share resources is a lot of transportation and technology costs - towns also share water resources","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes, but i don't see how libraries, even highly technologized ones, require more money than water treatment plants, equipment for water sewage, etc.","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"okay, so we'll make water resources more","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Offer-Commit"}
{"text":"what are the big expensese for libraries?","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"what will providing the library with a large amount of funding provide?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}

{"text":"books are expensive","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"but how many books are being bought new each year?","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"if u consider that nyc spends $262 million annually on water, thats a lot - but i dont know how it compares to other areas","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"wiw","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"wow*","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"thats alot","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"over 30% of your university's library budget is most likely spent on subscriptions to online databases and periodicals","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"The largest operating cost for most of these agencies is staffing","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"interesting","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"Each employee needs salary, health benefits, vacation ertc","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"etc","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"right, but same for the city employees who work at the plants","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"the New York Public Library has over $50 billion in annual public spending., which totally dwards all water costs for the city","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"or the senior services centers, for that matter","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"but how much of that is from the city?","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"How many donations did the NYPL receive last year?","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"and that's the nyc public library, which probably has rich donations behind it","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}

{"text":"david you are on fire","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes, it has rich donations","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}

{"text":"it wasnt intended to be humorous","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"lol","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"we need to start working toward a consensus that we can agree on for the most part","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"agreed","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Ok so say we revisit giving each 20% right out of the box ... then we take 15% away from seniors, and 10% away from Refuse and Recycling ... so Water and Sewer 20%, Highway and Roads 20%, Libraries 20% where do we spend the 25% extra?","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Or should we say ...","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"How about 5% each back to all?","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"this is what somebody proposed earlier, i like this the best of what we've discussed so far: Seniors 5%, Refuse and Recycling 8%, Libraries 12%, Water and Sewer 37.5%, and Highway and Roads 37.5 %","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i like that one the best as well","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"so 10% to seniors, 15% to refuse and recycling and the rest have 25%","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"well, water and sewer , roads - those should be high - but recycling seems too high, isn't a lot of that privatized anyway?","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"I like meg's idea","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I don't know, the whole recycling movement has taken off I think funding should be directed there more too","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"Yes but it's not just recycling ... it garbage too","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"right","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Landfills are expensive","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"right - like in most municipalities - you pay for it yourself","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But , as in back to the future, in a year we can put the trash in the car for gas - right","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"haha true","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"there are trash collection stations, those are sort of supported by the town - but i know in Guiderland and Niskayuna for example,","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah but Albany has city collection","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"your taxes DO NOT pay for trash pick up or recycling pick up and disposition, nor processing - thats all done by yourself","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Albany City? really","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"Yes","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"wow, so the city pays for that? -","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"I don't pay for trash at all","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"thats pretty good - so maybe you'd allocate some money there, in this particular case","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"me either","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"if we're talking about a city, then getting rid of trash is important","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"the town does own and operate a transfer station, but the percentage is proly too high - i wont quibble on details though , it might make sense just to make this easy","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think I am deciding that Highways and Roads need the most","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Water and Sewer next","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"And the Library and Seniors on the next tier","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah, with the way Americans drive and how this is so car-centric and theres so much sprawl and lack of public transportation and high speed trains that europe and asia has, we should spend a lot more on roads","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"true","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"good point","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Hey ... they tried to build a monorail system through downtown Seattle and the tax payers shot it down","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"Even in places like Seattle with TONS of public transportation people won't use it","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"They had insentives were you could get paid to take it","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"this is a mixture of what some people said before","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"ny is really the only true exception","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"although the water and highway might be switched based on what was just said","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"You mean NYC","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"no, there's a whole rail system in san francisco","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}

{"text":"I live in Cortland","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"a lot of people refer to it just simply as New York","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"and there is no public transportation","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"There are short buses for the disables and that is it","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"NYC is like if you're going to differentiate b\/n upstate and downstate, but upstate is not really that important in comparison","speaker":"david","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}

{"text":"how about this? - Seniors 8%, Refuse and Recycling 10%, Libraries 15%, Water and Sewer 34.5%, and Highway and Roads 30.5 %","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"or swtich highways and water, based on recent conversations","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}

{"text":"to be efficient, we can go through the list and see if they fit the categories mentioned. ill keep a tally","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"sure","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"ok","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"good idea","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"for me, the google pioneers rang out","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"okay - first person, steve jobs","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"he was influential many years ago, but i don't think that has lasted","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he has helpd change social behavior quite a bit (similar to google)","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes there is so much influence caused by apple","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"in the way we socialize and use techonology","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"shall we keep him on the list for the moment?","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"sure","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"so there are 2 categories we have to consider when evaluating these people. category one, \"largest social and cultural impact\" yes? or no?","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"sounds good","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"that sounds good","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i say yes he fits it","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"as for largest social and cultural impact, i don't think so, but i'd agree to keep him on the list","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i think hes a good one to keep in mind","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"ok","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"second category: widely known, name is common knowledge","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"i say his name is not, but his brand is","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yes, i think so too","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"apple is everywhere","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"true","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"a lot of people know his name simply because he is so wealthy","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"same with bill gates","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes i believe they fall into a similar category","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i think bill's name is definitely known- at least for \"computer stuff\" lol","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"haha yes","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"okay - so he fits the first one better than the second criteria. made an impact but name is not a household name","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"the two names are quite similar though","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he also has to be worlwide known and influential, not just us. and i think he fits that criteria as well","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"(or she)","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"thats a good point","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i think worldwide recognition is important","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"how about barack obama, the next on the list?","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"so from 1-5 how would we rate steve jobs on the first category","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"is 1 most or least influential?","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"id go with a 3","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"1 is most influential?","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"i'd go with a 3 as well","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"3- middle of the road","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"okay, so 3 it is. for the second criteria?, 1-5","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"wait, is 1 most or least influential?","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"least deat","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"*least","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"ok","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"i feel as if there was so much hype surrounding him during his election and his fight for change, etc.","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but in terms of his actual presidency","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"im not sure if hes as influential as we thought he would be","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yet anyway","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"no dear, were talking about steve jobs, second criteria","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"right, i agree","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"oh sorry!","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"oh, ok","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"1-5","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"i say 4","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"having a mac is the in thing now","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"or an ipod","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"it has def impacted our attitudes","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"what is the 2nd criteria?","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"their name is common knowledge, their contributions in their field have brought great attention to that field or to themselves and have profoundly affected our attitudes","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i'd say 3. but i still have a pc :)","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and no ipod","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"name common= 3","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"contributions= 4","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i agree with macy","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"and worldwide?","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"i would guess a 2 or 3 for that","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"we have to come up with one number","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"so either 2 3 or 4","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"2","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"isn't worlwide a 3rd separate criteria, though?","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"2","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i'd go with 2 as well for contributions","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"1= least influential correct?","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"yes, i think so macy","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yes macy","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"theres only 2 criterias, they are the 2 paragraphs   lists","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well, i think it's important to consider them being internationally influential vs. domestically influential is important as well","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"that's a lot of info for the second criteria","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"the largest social and cultural impact could mean both natioanl and internl","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"thats a good way to analyze it","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"she does say worldwide","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so its included in there","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and contributions aren't, though?","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"most of the contendors on this list are american","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"yes, it is very american heavy","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"so steve jobs, second criteria","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"but not all have the same international impact","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yes i noticed that as well","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"so...i think we just need to see them as \"most\" influential or not","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"okay","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"steve jobs, second criteria, influential or not","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"yeah some i can definetly see as only american influential","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"me too","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i say influential","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i agree","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}

{"text":"wait, then what is the number?","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"didn't you want to get one number, jake?","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"macy proposed not to do the numbers lynn","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"before moving on?","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"ok, sorry, i must have missed that","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"i did?","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"were just saying influential or not for both criteria","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"macy: so...i think we just need to see them as \"most\" influential or not","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"oh i didnt mean we shouldnt use numbers","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"sorry, i'm confused......","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Signal-Non-Understanding"}
{"text":"but whatever works honestly","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"i think thats better - narrows it down","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"ok","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"ya.","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"okay - so obama ladies, influential or not?","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"def","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"but not for the past 10 years","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}

{"text":"yea, considering the decade, i dont think hes influential","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"right","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"well i think his impact is very influential eventho he hasnt been around long","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he changed years and years of american history","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"what has been his social\/cultural influence- he certainly has made history","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"yes, but as far as contributions to his field, that has yet to be determined","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"his social influence is that he inspires minorities to think they can do whatever they want in terms of reaching their dreams","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"for a black to be president, it serves as inspiration to minorities","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i agree","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i just dont see his contributions influencing the world (yet)","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah i agree with jake and lynn","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"he is definetly influential socially","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"im not sure if his contributions will be heavily influential","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"as of yet","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"that could certainly change though","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"and he's definitely impacted the world, not just the US","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"but not more so than others on this list, in my opinio","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"ya. he needs a little more time for his influence to be seen worldwide","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"or *because* of others on this list","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah i think he needs more time","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"so not influential for the first criteria?","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"correct","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i would say influential for the first, not for the second","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i think its the other way lynn","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"what is the first and second?","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"well actually","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i don't see it that way","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"yea, i think i'm confused about the criteria","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"okay - the 1st one is the 1st paragraph","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}

{"text":"isn't the first social and cultural impact?","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"yes correct lynn. thats the 1st one coz its the 1st paragraph","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}

{"text":"macy","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"name may not be known, but contributions could be Very influential","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"okay","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"2nd criteria?","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"because of him being the first african american president","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think not influential","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"for it to be only 2 categories","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"can we vote yes or no, as him being Most Influential overall","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}

{"text":"luke, would you mind facilitating the discussion today?","speaker":"moderator","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"Sure","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"For today, my discussion is if you had to pick one state to live in for the rest of your life, where would it be and why?","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Wait...I thougt this was the group that you had to disuss resumes","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Am I in the right place?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"yes you are wrong luke","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yes, please review the materials on link","speaker":"moderator","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"link","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yea I thought the email said the discussion was on the resumes","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":":-D that was not supposed to be mean luke","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"here's the link luke","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"haha oh ok. I do not believe I saw the e-mail","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I like the discussion idea luke, we can use it for later. :-)","speaker":"moderator","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I have a question about the job description. Many of the applicants mention computer skills but the description doesn't require any. Correct?","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"Oh OK even better.. You have to select, as a group, one job candidate from the candidate below for the given job.","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Correct, it does not mention any computer skills required","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"From the first look, who does everyone would be the most qualified?","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"ya rita thats corrext","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i have a quick question... when i signed on here there were two different chats open or so i thought so... i just picked a random one is that ok?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Do computer skills fall into the category of strong communication skills?","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I think Carla and Robert have the most relevant experience for the job","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"go to your email... it tells u what chat you are in","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"However, I think they're the least profession","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i see kk","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"*professional","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"i agree with u irene","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Carla has CPR training which I think is extremely helpful for a counselor","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i agree about carla","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I think that Carla is the best","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"not sure about roberth though","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"Well Robert was a teaching assistant","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I don't like how he started saying how the job could help HIM","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"You're supposed to say how you can help the job","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i debated between robert and emily for second place","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"hmmm i didnt get an email with a group specified","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Carla has worked with kids up to 6 years old and Robert works with College students - the target audience is 7-14 year olds. That doesn't mean they wouldn't be good though.","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well why i wasnt sure about robert was that who was he teaching?","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"hello","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Conventional-Opening"}
{"text":"this is true carla","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"That's true rita","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Emily said she had experience with \"child care\" and said nothing else about it","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he could still be good but I myself have worked with kids before and you have to know a good amount about the age group","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I still think carla is the most qualified","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yea, I think it would be a lot easier for Carla to go right into this type of job compared to Robert who would have to make a pretty quick transition","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i only considered emily because she mentioned child care, majored in communications, and had experience with the red cross","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i still think carla is the best","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah I think so too","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"definitely carla... have we ruled all the others out besides carla, robert, and emily?","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"i agree with melany","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"She also has hobbies that are relevant to teenagers","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Richard at first glance seemed the worst qualified i thought","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I was personally only really interested with Carla and Robert","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Richard's resume was easy to read","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Richard was the only one who mentioned he was flexible","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"carla seem to understand what it takes to take care of a 6 yr old.","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah, Carla also has leadership experience as a student council vice president","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"The posting said the person must be flexible","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i especially like that she described what she did with takin care of the child","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Richard and Mark seemed more business-like","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Carla didn't mention her GPA but I don't think teens really care about her GPA","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well it doesnt ask for college degree","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think an interview would be necessary for all of these candidates","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think the only good things about Richard was his flexible schedule and previous tutoring experience","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yea and others resumes really didn't have much in them that are needed to do such a job like this","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"None of them seemed horrible","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Richard wants to work in a corporate setting ... sounds like. And Mark's experience is more to do with fundraising. Neither have skills with kids listed.","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea i dont think the gpa really matters that much as long as someone has good experience","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I agree with rita","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"so, right now, who have we said that we like? its down to carla and who?","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I think the most important thing for a job is experience, rather than GPA and other jobs you've had","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah i have to agree","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Robert and Carla","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i agree, experience is the most important facor","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yea","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"when you apply for a job what is most important is providing relevant information","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"okay.. i vote for carla","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"it shows that you care and are truly intrested","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i also vote for carla","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It says experience \"preferred\" not required","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"That's true","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Again, wouldn't an interview be necessary?'","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I think it should be between robert and carla though","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"They should all have interviews","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"hey she has a cpr\/ first aid cert","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"carla i mean","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think robert would be responsible but not as \"into\" the position as carla","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"thats really important","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"true","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"How about references. Talking to their past supervisors might be helpful","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Oh yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"No one included references","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah an interview is necessary","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"carla could have a terrible personality","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"However, the job posting didn't ask for references","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"this is true","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"true","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"exactly.. usually with a resume you don't post them unless asked too","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think robert's experience is more of a \"teacher\" like description. the demographics that he worked with is not what the ymca position entails","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But when it comes to working with children.. someone who has experience with them opposed to someone who has not is more likely to get the job because it really does take time to know how to act and build up a lot of patience","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"thats true luke","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"That's true","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But again I think we need an interview","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes luke you really have to not be so much of professional but more or less be a role model","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"They could write whatever they want, but they could be really awkward in person","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes i agree","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yea you cant really judge a person on paper that well","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"based on solely resumes, who would everyone pick?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Carla","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"carla definitely","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"experience is the most important..they will deal with the kids alot better than someone without any experience","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Right cinthia thats the word I was looking for Role Model and almost an extension to their parents","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It says children ages 7-14 so they are also dealing with younger children","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i would choose carla as well","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"It seems based on the job description - Emily with the communications major and the child care experience is a front runner with the information provided - I do wish she had elaborated on her child care experience","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I am currently taking a emt class and i can tell you that the leading cause of death for children is respiratory arrest","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes i agree","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"ya... and the age group robert has an experience with is not the same as what the ymca position is asking for","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i was torn between emily and carla","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i wish she elaborated as well","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think having CPR skills is really helpful","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"she could have more experience than carla","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"rita.. i did not even really consider emily until you said that","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and her red cross experience is helpful","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeaa me neither","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"what are the differences between emily and carla?","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"yea but it does not say what age group emily was involved with","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"there's not much description in her resume","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think it's impossible to make the correct decision simply based on a resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"besides her marketing experience","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think the red cross experience is important - but anyone hired for this job will probably have to undergo training ... ergo if she has it already ...","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Even the job description is a bit vgue","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"*vague","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"i dont like emily's resume","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Carla cared for one single girl as opposed to Emily who put child care which could be more than one person and also could have been a different job related to this one","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i dont either","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and no one listed their work availability, unless i missed that?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"so? I mean emily doesnt seem put together enough to me","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"The job posting says they will get training","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"They might all be qualified","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"if she really wanted the job she could have put more effort into her resume","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i agree with ariel","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"My first job I've ever had was a CIT at age 13","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"emily's resume is bare","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I didn't get a paid job until I was 16","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"whats a CIT?","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Counselor in Training","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I was supervised by other counselors too","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But there were times if a bunch of kids had to go to the bathroom, I'd be watching a bunch of kids on my own for a few minutes","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"you know i really wish we had some ages for these people","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"really? even though you were so young?","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"So my point is...when working with kids, you don't really need experience","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"you just need to be responsible","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Well they all seem to be graduates of college","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I agree with melany","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"The resumes did show responsibility","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and besides, im sure YMca will give them some training","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"All of them","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"they all seem pretty responsible to me","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think they are all qualified","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"that could mean anything I am in undergrad with a 50 year old man who is gonna graduate next semester","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"they cant just throw them into the lions","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"just some would do better with others","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Well we can infer a little from dates of graduation about age","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Well a 50 year old man might have kids of his own","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Should age matter? Wouldn't that be discrimination?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"One is a masters student - he's the oldest ... most likely","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes descrimination definitely","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yea age should not matter","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"definetly can't discriminate based on age","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i work for a recruiting office for northwestern mutual and we can no matter what ask about age or personal life","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"although perhaps someone younger may have more energy to deal with the kids","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but thats subjective","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"being that some people older than me have more energy than me haha","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I'm young but kids wear me out","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"would you prefer to have a 50 year old or a 20 year old working with your kids?","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"It depends","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"same here","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"but i think age tells you a bit more about character","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Sorry I am coming into this late. Are you debating Carla versus Emily?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"What if it's a 50 year old mom who has 5 kids of her own","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"it helps build your idea of the person","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"The 20 year old might know nothing about kids","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"were still debating between everyone pretty much","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"when i worked with kids we had older councelors that acted as the grandparents of the groups and really added to the atmosphere","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i thought we have settled between carla and robert","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"The posting says \"we value diversity!\"","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"they really were more respected, not as fun but more respected","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah i was a camp counselor and the older ones were more respected","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"by far","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I don't think age really matters.. If your good with kids than thats all that matters at the end of the day.","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"what does robert have to bring again?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Why are you considering Robert? He has no experience, nor shows any interest, in young children.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"He worked as a teaching assistant","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"My three year old went to camp this past summer and the main counselor was college age and the junior counselors were high school age","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"He worked in academia.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes but you want diversity in the work place it matters if all your councilors are 20","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"When you work with kids in a camp, a lot of times you do educational activities","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he has demonstrated an ability to lead as a TA","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I don't believe the job announcement said that diversity was the object. It was simply that there would not be discrimination.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Well it says diversity is valued","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But I feel like jobs have to say that","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"exactly","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I work for a school aged care program at the moment and the employees ages range from 17-30... Not saying that someone older than that wouldnt be good for the job, it just seems they are more in charge of the actual office things","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but like i said, the demographics are different","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Sure, diversity is valued. But Robert is not equal in experience to Carla in this field.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"the ymca position will deal with 7-14 yr old","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Well as a teaching assistant he might work with kids of all ages","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"ok so who should we definitely eliminate?","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"good call josh","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"mark? any thoughts?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"he was my first eliminated","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I really don't think we should eliminate anyone before interviewing them","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Well, that is something that could be flushed out in an interview. But if this has to be decided without an interview, then you have to judge by what they state on their resumes.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"We have another hour to talk","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes very true","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"That's good.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It never said we can't discuss how to improve the resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Or how to move on after the resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and plus you cant just interview everyone who send a resume, you gotta weed out the ones that are not sufficient for the job","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"exactly","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"That's true cinthia","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i agree with cinthia","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"ok - so i am ready to interview - let's role play ... any volunteers to be certain people for a chat interview?","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"We're only looking at 5 resumes but in real scenarios we'd probably be looking at much more","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":":-)","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"I know I came to this late, but I'm wondering how the others were eliminated so quickly.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I don't think it's possible to role play with the information we have","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"So if we were to weed them out than it seems as though the 3 we would interview would be Emily, Jason and Carla, right?","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"true","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i agree with cinthia. we have to be efficient and cut off those who dont meet what the job description says","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Jason?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Signal-Non-Understanding"}
{"text":"Sorry,","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Robert","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"thats ok luke","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"we only interview those that have potential","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Or we can interview everyone","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"we cant interview everyone","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"They all seem responsible","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It depends","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"If we only got 5 applicants, we could definitely interview all 5","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"If we got 100 applicants, then we'd have to narrow it down","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"For our purposes I think they gave us 5 because looking at 100 applicants would be ridiculous","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"If I was the person doing the interviews I would start by doing telephone interviews with each to get that additional information we don't have. Then choose the top two or three to bring in for interviews","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"exactly irene","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Well, what kinds of questions would we ask?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I think Mark's resume shows absolutely no interest in this job. His background is biology and fundraising. Are we all agreed, and that's 9 of us, that Mark is eliminated.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I guess we can","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think mark was a bad candidate","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea marks out of the discussion","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Okay","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"7\/9 agree i think unless i cant count","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"whose next to be eliminated?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"As for Richard, he has tutored students in grades 3-5 in science. That seems to be about his only experience related to this.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Mark did work with the new student orientation","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea and he said that his hours are flexible","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"rita, how do you think that that relates to the YMCA position?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"New Student Orientation could be any ages","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"*age","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"yea and its directly dealing with kids","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But he did not tailor his resume to let us know that the ages were the same range, so should we assume that they are different?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i agree with tia","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Well, Robert worked with college age students and you like him ... Mark apparently worked with some college freshman too","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he didnt really make it clear that qualified him","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"no we shouldnt. but i never had new student orientation in elementary or middle school","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so i would assume its college","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I asked why Mark was being considered. I am not in favor of him.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"me either","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I'm definitely not in favor of Mark","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"same","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But I think it would be wrong to eliminate him completely before properly interviewing him","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I am playing devils advocate ... Mark's out","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Hahah I agree with rita","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I also am not in favor of Robert. His resume, in my opinion, clearly indicates to me that he is interested in college age students and academia.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I mean if we're really picking at it","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well you cant interview everyone and we arent going to be interviewing anyone anyway","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Carla has grammar problems in her resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I thought Robert seemed better than Richard","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"tia, that was what the point i was trying to make","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"we only have the resumes to look at","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Richard was the least impressive to me","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But one thing I liked about him","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"He mentioned that he's flexible","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"College age students studying like English literature ... not education or communications or sports management","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"And the posting said that you need to be flexible","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"What if Carla is only available one day per week?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Yeah, his flexibility seemed appealing","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yea, they all probably should have put down times available","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"man if i were hiring i would just wait for more applicants","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but we really cannot even make a decision without knowing everything we need to know","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"these guys really suck","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"The most important thing is for the person we hire to work well with the children in the program, and to meet the goals of the program.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I agree with ariel","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Yeah they should have mentioned their availablity","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"because without all the criteria we could make the wrong decision based on experience but they cant work certain days and what not","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yep","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But than again, I would think if they are applying for a job that states you need to be available Mon-Fri from 4-8 than they would be available","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"You'd be surprised","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"alre we allowed to pick no one?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"We're allowed to do whatever we want","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"We have until 9:30","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"So we could discuss everything about this","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yea some may think they only have to work one dya a week","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It says \"various weekend shifts\" as well","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It says the Mon-Fri 4-8 is mandatory","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"the schedule i guess would be determined in an interview","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"for weekends anyways","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"oh okay so they must think they have to work M-F","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Some jobs like to spring it on you","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Which is really annoying","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea the mon-fri is mandatory","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea it is","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I've worked in retail and they have this call-in nonsense where you have to wait around and call an hour or two before to see if they need you","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"this really leaves way too much to interpretation... the post looks like it was written by captain vague and well to be honest none of the applicants seem much better","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"And this job might do that on weekends","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"me too irene!","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"worst thing ever!","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I agree melany","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I think they purposely made it all vague","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think Carla is a strong candidate because she was a nanny for one year, has some learning in psychology, is CPR and 1st Aid certified, and has a clean driver's license (the latter meaning she might not have to rely on public transportation to get to work). I would assume, like it was mentioned ea!\n rlier, that she would not be applying if she could not work out the hours.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It gives us more to talk about","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"who is captain vague? hah that was funny","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"haha. i think the description is vague as well","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"tia makes a good point","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I feel like the others may have similar qualifications as Carla","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but just dont mention it","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"idk why","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"havent we said before that carla is a good candidate","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"captain vague = the writer of the job discription","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I aree","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"some resumes r so vague","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think Emily is a strong candidate because she has a background in child care. As a marketing intern, she probably developed her communication skills. Also, she tailored her resume to state that her objective was to get this job.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"*I agree with melany","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"I'm on a site that talks about resumes","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"link","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"We shouldn't be looking at any candidates who do not show interest in children in the age group of 7 to 14.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"None of them say they DONT have interest in those kids","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i agree with tia","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"They all mention kids at least once","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"then again i was a camp counselor and never had prior child care experience","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah, that's what I meant","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"When I said I was a Counselor In Training as my first job","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"That was my background for future jobs","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I worked with kids before I worked in retial","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"the demographics of whom the candidates had experience with matters","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"They teach you","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It's not hard","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"They said they will have training","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It really is a \"no-brainer\" type job, as long as you're responsible and willing to learn","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I agree with melany","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"jake- I was thinking about that too","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"When you don't have a background for the position you're looking for, you're supposed to do something with your resume to let them know why you want this job. And not because you need a job. But because this is something you're really looking for, and that you will not be a burden to your employer.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"However, some camps have counselors from different countries","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"tia has made a good point","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"However, Carla shows experience but she might be a mean person in real life","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"She might hate kids","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah she might be really shy or hard to deal with","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"how would you evaluate that irene","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I forgot who said this, but based on resumes, I wasn't really impressed either","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"An interview","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"It could be as simple as stating that I was one of twelve children, and I know all about dealing with children. Something as to why you and the job can be a match.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think it would be wrong to pick someone based on a resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"And tia made another good point","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"we cant interview though","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"I noticed none of these candidates really made the point why they should be hired","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Which is the purpose of a resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"From what I could tell, we are supposed to pick based on the resumes.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah they didnt make very good points","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"how else would you narrow down who youll interview if you dont lok at their resume'","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"True","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i wish my roomates were here they both actually worked at the ymca","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Obviously, with the exception of Robert, these are younger people applying for the job.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"That's not necessarily obvious","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"One would not expect beautiful resumes from them.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"they would provide good input ariel","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"True, but I think we could all write better resumes","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"sorry about that i was disconnected..","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"The task is ... \"Your topic of discussion will be selecting one job candidate to interview from a list of resumes for a given job.\"","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Carla did write her interests though","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea so at the end of this we have to have someone","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"rita, I couldn't find that...so it's good you brought it up","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"what were the gramatical errors someone found in carlas resume?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"We just have to pick who gets an interview","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I don't know I feel like Carla awkwardly worded certain parts","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"don't look at me grammer is not my forte","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I feel like grammar might not be that big of an issue as a YMCA counselor? but i could be wrong...i just assumed writing wasn't that important for the job","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"The CPR\/1st Aid Certified is a big plus for Carla.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think Carla has the most benefits","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"as do i","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"She would definitely be the best to interview","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think we all agree on that","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Yes","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yea","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But we have to talk until 9:30","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"She is definetly the top candidate","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think we should talk about what we'd ask Carla during an interview","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"lol cant we ask for another topic?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Doubtful","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"In the real world we would take like 15 minutes to pick two to have come for interviews .. done and over. In this exercise we have an hour and a half to beat it to death","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"LOL","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"That's true","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Who would be the next person we would ask to interview?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Well the way I would go about this is if you were to pick one of these people for your own children if you had them, what would you ask them?","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Good point luke","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Hmmmm....","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"Why don't we figure out what we'd ask Carla","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"good question","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Then pick our next choice","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"ok","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"good idea","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"And figure out what to ask them","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"I would ask Carla how she liked being a nanny, and why that position ended?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"or ask her what are the challenges she has had working with kids","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Good points","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"And also what she likes about working with kids","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"How about asking Carla how she does with multiple children","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"Why does she want to work at YMCA","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"what was her most difficult child care experience (similar to jake's question)","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"how did she handle it","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"As Student House Council Vice President, it shows that she was picked to lea","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"why didnt she run for president?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yea and what about her separates her from the others to be able to have this job","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"hey why does carla live in boston but want to work in albany?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I'd like to know what Lotus 1-2-3 is","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Good point ariel","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I would ask her why she became CPR\/1st aid certified? Seems to me that there might be some experience she had, maybe volunteer, that that was connected with and is not on her resume.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"what subjects did she tutor?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"She attends school in Albany","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Didn't she graduate?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"nah she's still working on her masters in accounting","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Ohh","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"how long does she plan to stick around","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Good point","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"a masters can take as little as 2 years","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"why does she want to work with children if her focus is accouting?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"2008 - present","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"even less if you really pile it on","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so graduation 2011","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea thats a very good question ariel.. most places are looking for a long term employee that the kids can get used to","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well one thing that should be asked is if she can work the assigned hours and on various weekends","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so do we want to hire someone if we dont know she is gonna stick around?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"we can also ask carla why shes interested in concentrating in psych, maybe she will maeke a connection with working with kids","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah good point","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I don't know if that is supposed to be a Master's.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It states High School right before it.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Might be, as earlier pointed out, a messy resume.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Carla's high school concentration is psychology (I didn't know you could have a concentration in High School) anyway her college degree is in accounting","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well either way you dont have to have a college degree for the job","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"definetly a messy resume","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Where's the BA or BS?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"yeah you could be in HS for this job","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"look here","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"link","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"we could also ask to speak with the family carla was a nanny for so we can ask them how she was and why she left","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Well if you're in high school then it might be awkward if the kid is 14 and you're 15","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"oh right i forgot the age group","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"yea I think this job would have to be alteast 18 to qualify for","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i was thinking of the camp i worked out","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"haha my mistake","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"at*","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"that link was to help with what is an ma","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"sorry to be kinda random i should've labeld it :p","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well usually you have to be 18 or older to work with kids at the Y don't you?","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"ok sorry didnt see your post luke","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeaaa","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"These people all have college experience so we don't have to worry about that","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But it was kind of a good point - working with kids doesn't take a genius","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"If a thirteen year old can work with kids without relevant experience","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"(like I did)","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea all of the are most likely in their 20s","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Then how much do we need?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"yes but you said you were a CIT right?","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"One of the things an employer looks for is to not hire someone only to have that someone leave within a couple of weeks. The employer wants someone to stay on.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I mean we should probably take into consideration that they are the lead counselor and they need full responsibility","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes i agree irene","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"well i was kind of thinking... like having someone who is more academically inclined might help because you do need to help kids with their homework i know that for sure since my room mate mentioned it","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Carla is probably the choice people pick without analyzing her resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think you may be the exception to the age rule irene","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Not really","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"There were lots of 13 year old CITS","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I just checked the YMCA website and camp counselors have to be at least 18 years of age","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But I was under supervision","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"also i think its important to note that one of my room mates that actually worked at the ymca was a elementary school teacher.. and the other was a certified RN","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I'm still at Carla's resume, and how one jumps from HS to MA. Probably supposed to be BA.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well if you were a CIT... thats kind of a position where you dont need to have experience because that is the main job of training to become an actual couselor","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think they purposely put someone like Carla to trick out","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"*us","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"She SEEMS the most qualified","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But she has flaws","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Location, availability, etc","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"actually tia i do want to mention that although perhaps your right there are programs at suny that allow you to take classes for both","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"She's \"too easy\"","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"If they all get training, they might be up to par or above par","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"at the same time and earn ba and ma simultaneously","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I can't imagine that that program is for the average student.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I wonder if Carla would be persuing this career long term","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"That might be true but it doesn't really matter what they have in my opinion","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Unless they're lying","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Which in that case they shouldn't get hte job","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"eh... we can pick no one at the end","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"as i said if it were me hiring","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I agree","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i would just wait for someone better","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"that someone better may never come","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i would probably just settle and pick carla","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Might as well interview her","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"depending on the demand","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It doesn't mean we have to hire her after the interview","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Why don't we begin over by agreeing what we are looking for in a candidate? Assume that the YMCA does not want quick turnover.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"We'd ask her about availability and such","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Do any of the candidates show a long-term commitment to any employment?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Its pretty hard to decide on these people just based on their resume... they could all be really great with kids but wed never know unless you met them and saw how their personalites were","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"in the end we need to select someone though","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"YMCA would want someone who likes children, available during hours, available for a wide range of time, etc","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think it woulve helped if there was an availability form they filled out","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"It doesn't help to complain about the process we are using.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"hell i mean carla could be a really creepy lady","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"We're only allowed to interview one person","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i dont understand how availablity wasnt questioned","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Might as well pick Carla sine she seems the most qualified","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I just feel that she wouldn't get hired","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It's set up this way because what we say to each other is being studied for a purpose.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But I think we all brought up good points","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I agree","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Obviously if we started talking about football or something then we'd be off topic","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"We overanalyzed all of them","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Agreed","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But we have another half hour","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"hey i wonder what kind of neighborhood did she work in? is it actually in existence and also what kind of neighborhood is her permanent residence like in boston?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I don't think we've overanalyzed.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"How far is Boston from Albany anyway?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Some people are crazy and travel every day","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"If the job starts at 4pm","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It's undoubtedly set up this way for us to be quizzical.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"2 hours by grey hound","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"She could spend her day driving","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"maybe 3","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I wonder if this is a real posting","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"me too","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"The other group is talking about Obama","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i hightly doubt that","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think we just have to accept that we are to pick one person to interview no matter what we would otherwise do in the \"real world.\"","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"We all clearly agree Carla is the best choice","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It doesn't mean she'll get hired","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yes I think so","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Would anyone pick someone besides Carla?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"In the real world you can't interview every single applicant","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think Emily is also a strong candidate.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"instead of still talking about carla... maybe we could talk about why we wouldn't pick another candidate?","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I was really turned off by Robert when he said what the job could do for HIM","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But I really liked his teaching assistant experience","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"people can relocate for a job though..if carla would move closer to the job area then she is definitely the best choice","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"And he was also participating in Drama which would probably mean he's entertaining","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think Emily could defeat Carla if she had a better personalituy","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Emily didn't even really mention her experience with children at all","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Emily did child care.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"she would need to elaborate upon that","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Definitely","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"she could have babysat once","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeaa not really specific but its there","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"What would come out in any interview is more detail than is in any of these resumes.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah she could've babysat her cousin or something","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But it says after school and on weekends","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea it could be anything for her experience","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"which is what the job is looking for","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Plus she lives in Albany","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"could have been a lie","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"thats a plus","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"They all could be a lie","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"How is babysitting a cousin not relevant if she had responsibility and did a great job?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Well, dealing with any type of kids whether its family or someone elses it still useful experience to have","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but why would they lie?","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"It didn't say who she provided care for, where, etc. So she could be making that up","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah just to get an interview","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"either way the employer will find out and they will be fired","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Fired? I'd just say not hired at all","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"unless she tells her cousin to lie for her or something","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"childcare is an extremely tight career and if you are untruthful you definitely get reprimanded","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i feel child care experience could be easily manipulated and embellished","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yes","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"future jobs can be at stake","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"thats why we dont interview those who didnt elaborate on their resumes","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Therefore we should interview none of them","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"coz theyre mad suspect","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Well I guess Carla we should","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea.. without an interview we really dont know the specifics so by just basing it off the resumes you kind of have to go with it","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"It's their fault they didn't improve their resumes","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"There are plenty of sites that tell you how to create a resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Just google it","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea and thats all we have to choose from is there resumes","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeaa","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Real employers aren't going to all be like, \"I bet they could possibly have a good personality!\"","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"hahaha exactly","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"They don't want to waste their time and efforts on who COULD be good","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"duhhh","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"yea they arent very good","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"something on paper needs to jump out at them","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"So in the real world, Carla would probably be the only one they'd care about","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Because she has qualities that stick out","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think new job seekers have to be given a break. They can't be expected to have the wonderful resumes that come with experience. And that is experience that teaches one that it is okay to \"brag\" about what one has done.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"time + effort cost money'","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It doesn't have to be wonderful","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But for example","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Carla wrote her interests","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"And those interests would most likely be done at camps","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"The other people might not have experience","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and carla described what she did","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"personally if i had no experience then i would write something about why i think i would be a good candidate anyway","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But they could've put something like enjoys arts and crafts, sports, etc","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"That's why I'm a bit hung up on Carla and the jump from H.S. to M.A. If she is older than I initially thought her to be (undergraduate age), then her resume should be much better.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"True","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Yeah I am curious about that as well","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I don't get why these things are an hour and a half","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"thats not true i mean someone could graduate at 17 and finish there masters by age 23","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"There are many ways to truthfully embellish a resume.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"thats not that old","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Age shouldn't be a factor","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But there are years not accounted for on her resume.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i am 21 i dont have much experience with jobs because school is my main focus","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah same","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Before you graduate you should at least get an internship relating to what kind of job you want","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"And you could get credits for those","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yess easier said than done sometimes though","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"ariel, do you indicate the year you got your HS diploma? Dates you are in college? Dates you worked at a job?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I mean some of the people applying went to SUNY Albany which offers internships so they have no excuse","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"luke i have had three in the past two years","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i dont know if i could get an internship after college ...","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It's tough","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"not with my type of job espcially","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But I'm just saying, if you have NEVER had experience","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"it all depends","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"There are always places you could volunteer for free","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Especially relating to kids","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"3? very impressive you should be ready to jump into that real world cinthia","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"There's UKids on campus which allows you to work there for free for class credits","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea places usually dont give interships if you graduate","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"This YMCA gig doesn't require prior experience so it would be considered an entry level position right?","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"Yes","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"and to answer you tia of course i would put all the dates down... im just saying there could be a reason","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Experience preferred but not necessary","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I think it is an entry level position","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think it's definitely important to take into account empty dates","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Everyone needs to start somewhere","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Jobs definitely do that","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah exactly","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"ariel, do you think the reason some people don't put the dates down is because they want to \"hide\" periods of unemployment, etc., so that they do not get initially screened out and have the opportunity to meet the employer face-to-face to explain?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"i agree that she should have put down that she is going for her ba and ma or that she finished it already","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"My first two jobs ever were babysitting and day camp junior counselor ... while I was in middle school","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but i dont think we should knock her compleatly due to that","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"That's just something we can ask in an interview","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah sometimes people struggle with personal issues","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I'm not saying we should knock her completely. I'm thinking that we should further analyze.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"exactly","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"thats true","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah i agree","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But really, as long as they're willing to learn - for this type of job - training is given and whatever she doesn't know she can learn","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes very true","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Oh, luke to answer your original question ... Washington State ... no state income tax","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Maybe Carla didn't work because she had kids","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Hawaii","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"So with about 20 minutes left, are we definately set on a person or maybe 2 top people?","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"carla","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"hands down","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Carla is clearly our top choice","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"carla","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"ok good","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"It doesn't say we need a second choice","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"all in favor of carla say aye","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"But I guess we might as well","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"aye","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"aye","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"aye","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"AYEEEEEEEEEEEEEE","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"lol","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"i","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Carla and Emily","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"hahhah josh","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":":-D","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"nah, only one person it said","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"but we still need to talk","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah carla","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so we choose carla?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"si","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"hai!","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"congrats carla","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"What do you think they're looking for ?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Carla and Emily. But again, CPR and First Aid are definite pluses for Carla.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"For emily ... right - she's the red cross chick","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Oh yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"so she has experience in case something goes wrong","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea..","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I feel like jobs just glance over resumes though","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Ooops Carla","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"So in real life, Carla would get the interview","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"sounds like it","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"sure","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yea i like carla for the interview","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I wonder if they were only looking to hire one person?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"does it say?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"lol this is gonna sound crazy but another room mate had volunteered for disaster relief and he had cpr training... but its expired now because it has to be re done every few years","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i know... i have 8 room mates :p","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Wow","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"Roommates or suitemates?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"i have 9 roommates","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"uhhh i live off campus in a big house so....","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"ohhhhh that makes sense","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"Yes, they have to be re-certified CPR every few years.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"ditto it gets a little girl razy","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think its every 2","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"Could be.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"The red cross is one year, the american heart association is 2 years.","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"for cpr cert","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"oh wow","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"so she is no longer certified i bet","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"she could re test for it tho","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Guys, don't be so untrustworthy.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"besides i will tell you from talking to the paramedics at my emt class that cpr techniques do change","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so it is important","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"ive heard that too","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"expecially dealing with children","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Again, they all get training","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"The fact she has any experience is good","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"they have found better methods and such","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"The resumes are not the best in format, grammar, and style. But that doesn't make people liars. Hiding periods of unemployment, etc., is a normal acceptable technique; one just has to be on the look-out for it.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I still be anyone who gets hired for this job to work with youth will be required to do the trainning","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"* I still bet","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"yeah regardless of prior experience","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"If you were going to interview her, what do you think the most important question would be? Would you rather hire somebody who is OK with kids but available all the times or someone who is great but not available as much","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Depends on entire staffing","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"i'd choose the most available","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"and if ever theyre mad suspect for leaving out info on their resumes, then we can ask them in the interview","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"what does this \"training\" include? i mean its costly to train people for cpr and first aid","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"thats just what i've experienced while interviewing","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"especially if you have a high turn over rate","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"they usually pick the most available","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"In this economy you have the ability to get both","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"then again it depends on the job","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"sometimes with training... the person pays for it or their job pays them hourly depending on how much it is since they are doing it for work","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah i got paid for my training","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"samsies","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"me too","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"So, are we agreeing that we need someone who will stick with the job?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"Well we don't know if Carla will stick or not","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"She might","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"If so, the job has to be a good match for the person.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think we should stick with who's the most qualified and go on from there","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well at least the person needs to be able to complete the hours","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"they do","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"And the person has to have the ability to commit. Are these candidates too new to the world of work do have shown such a commitment in the past?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"yeaa its tough you need someone to be there for the hours but they also need to good at what they do","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Tough predicament","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"you dont want someone who sucks with kids but has a lot of free time so they can work 7 days a week haha","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"True","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Would you stick at a job that did not use your skills, required you to develop skills you did not foresee any future need for, and have you around kids that you find annoying?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Availability is a big deal ... when you are new at any job you will not get far unless you bend over to meet their schedule.","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i agree","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"They're all getting training","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Would you be taking the first opportunity to leave the job at the YMCA for a better job?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"the more available you are the more likely you are to absorb good experience","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"or a bad one... ;-)","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well if someone needs money and theres a job that they think they can get they may take it even if they dont like it... which is pretty common actually","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea and you never know if someone is going to leave a job","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"7 to 14 is not an easy age group","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"anything can happen","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i agree","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"they are difficult","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"that really isn't something the employer can infer at an interview ... if you will leave","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"there is always that risk","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"at least we decided on carla","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"ya they can ask trick questions though like where do you see yourself in 5 years","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Hahhaah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"yeaa","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}

{"text":"How do we get the $10?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Hmmm a gold medalist in the 2014 olymipcs","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"Yeah'","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"after all of the online sessions","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i wonder if they take into account that we may be a minority due to the fact that we are doing this for money","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I see","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"What do you mean ariel","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}

{"text":"Yeah but we still have to discuss the topic","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"true","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"We didn't choose the topics","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"We all had valid points","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"lol well its a good thing theres about 4 minutes left cause this topic has run its course","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But we're all Albany students","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It's all part of the statistical variables of the study ... right?","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"yeah but dont our ethical values impact how we would discuss a topic such as this?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"So it could technically not be a representative sample","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes i think so","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"UAlbany students, certain age group, etc","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and background and experience","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"i think they just needed participants","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes exactly irene!","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"And maybe some of us wouldn't have picked Carla if other didn't say so","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Or if others didn't make points","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I certainly didn't think of Emily as a choice","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"tru","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"We're apparently one of eight centers doing this study","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"Wait...I thougt this was the group that you had to disuss resumes","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"Am I in the right place?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}

{"text":"here's the link luke","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"haha oh ok. I do not believe I saw the e-mail","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I like the discussion idea luke, we can use it for later. :-)","speaker":"moderator","dialog_act":"Offer-Commit"}
{"text":"I have a question about the job description.  Many of the applicants mention computer skills but the description doesn't require any. Correct?","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"Oh OK even better..","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":" You have to select, as a group, one job candidate from the candidate below for the given job.","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Correct, it does not mention any computer skills required","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"From the first look, who does everyone would be the most qualified?","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"ya rita thats corrext","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i have a quick question... when i signed on here there were two different chats open or so i thought so... i just picked a random one is that ok?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Do computer skills fall into the category of strong communication skills?","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I think Carla and Robert have the most relevant experience for the job","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"go to your email... it tells u what chat you are in","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"However, I think they're the least profession","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i see kk","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"*professional","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"i agree with u irene","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Carla has CPR training which I think is extremely helpful for a counselor","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i agree about carla","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I think that Carla is the best","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"not sure about roberth though","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"Well Robert was a teaching assistant","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I don't like how he started saying how the job could help HIM","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"You're supposed to say how you can help the job","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"i debated between robert and emily for second place","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"hmmm i didnt get an email with a group specified","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Carla has worked with kids up to 6 years old and Robert works with College students - the target audience is 7-14 year olds. That doesn't mean they wouldn't be good though.","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well why i wasnt sure about robert was that who was he teaching?","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"hello","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Conventional-Opening"}
{"text":"this is true carla","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"That's true rita","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Emily said she had experience with \"child care\" and said nothing else about it","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"he could still be good but I myself have worked with kids before and you have to know a good amount about the age group","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I still think carla is the most qualified","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Yea, I think it would be a lot easier for Carla to go right into this type of job compared to Robert who would have to make a pretty quick transition","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i only considered emily because she mentioned child care, majored in communications, and had experience with the red cross","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i still think carla is the best","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah I think so too","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"definitely carla... have we ruled all the others out besides carla, robert, and emily?","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"i agree with melany","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"She also has hobbies that are relevant to teenagers","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Richard at first glance seemed the worst qualified i thought","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I was personally only really interested with Carla and Robert","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Richard's resume was easy to read","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Richard was the only one who mentioned he was flexible","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"carla seem to understand what it takes to take care of a 6 yr old.","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Yeah, Carla also has leadership experience as a student council vice president","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"The posting said the person must be flexible","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i especially like that she described what she did with takin care of the child","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Richard and Mark seemed more business-like","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Carla didn't mention her GPA but I don't think teens really care about her GPA","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well it doesnt ask for college degree","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"I think an interview would be necessary for all of these candidates","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think the only good things about Richard was his flexible schedule and previous tutoring experience","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Yea and others resumes really didn't have much in them that are needed to do such a job like this","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"None of them seemed horrible","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Richard wants to work in a corporate setting ... sounds like. And Mark's experience is more to do with fundraising. Neither have skills with kids listed.","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yea i dont think the gpa really matters that much as long as someone has good experience","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I agree with rita","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"so, right now, who have we said that we like? its down to carla and who?","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I think the most important thing for a job is experience, rather than GPA and other jobs you've had","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah i have to agree","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Robert and Carla","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i agree, experience is the most important facor","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yea","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"when you apply for a job what is most important is providing relevant information","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"okay.. i vote for carla","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"it shows that you care and are truly intrested","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i also vote for carla","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"It says experience \"preferred\" not required","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"That's true","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Again, wouldn't an interview be necessary?'","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"I think it should be between robert and carla though","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"They should all have interviews","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"hey she has a cpr\/ first aid cert","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"carla i mean","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"i think robert would be responsible but not as \"into\" the position as carla","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"thats really important","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"true","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"How about references. Talking to their past supervisors might be helpful","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"Oh yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"No one included references","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Yeah an interview is necessary","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"carla could have a terrible personality","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"However, the job posting didn't ask for references","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"this is true","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"true","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"exactly.. usually with a resume you don't post them unless asked too","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i think robert's experience is more of a \"teacher\" like description. the demographics that he worked with is not what the ymca position entails","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But when it comes to working with children.. someone who has experience with them opposed to someone who has not is more likely to get the job because it really does take time to know how to act and build up a lot of patience","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"thats true luke","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"That's true","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But again I think we need an interview","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes luke you really have to not be so much of professional but more or less be a role model","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"They could write whatever they want, but they could be really awkward in person","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes i agree","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yea you cant really judge a person on paper that well","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"based on solely resumes, who would everyone pick?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Carla","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"carla definitely","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"experience is the most important..they will deal with the kids alot better than someone without any experience","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Right cinthia thats the word I was looking for Role Model and almost an extension to their parents","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"It says children ages 7-14 so they are also dealing with younger children","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i would choose carla as well","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"It seems based on the job description - Emily with the communications major and the child care experience is a front runner with the information provided - I do wish she had elaborated on her child care experience","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I am currently taking a emt class and i can tell you that the leading cause of death for children is respiratory arrest","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}

{"text":"there's not much description in her resume","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I think it's impossible to make the correct decision simply based on a resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"besides her marketing experience","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I think the red cross experience is important - but anyone hired for this job will probably have to undergo training ... ergo if she has it already ...","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Even the job description is a bit vgue","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"*vague","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"i dont like emily's resume","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Carla cared for one single girl as opposed to Emily who put child care which could be more than one person and also could have been a different job related to this one","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i dont either","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"and no one listed their work availability, unless i missed that?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"so? I mean emily doesnt seem put together enough to me","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"The job posting says they will get training","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"They might all be qualified","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"if she really wanted the job she could have put more effort into her resume","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i agree with ariel","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"My first job I've ever had was a CIT at age 13","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"emily's resume is bare","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I didn't get a paid job until I was 16","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"whats a CIT?","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Counselor in Training","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}

{"text":"But there were times if a bunch of kids had to go to the bathroom, I'd be watching a bunch of kids on my own for a few minutes","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"you know i really wish we had some ages for these people","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"really? even though you were so young?","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"So my point is...when working with kids, you don't really need experience","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"you just need to be responsible","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Well they all seem to be graduates of college","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I agree with melany","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"The resumes did show responsibility","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"and besides, im sure YMca will give them some training","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"All of them","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"they all seem pretty responsible to me","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i think they are all qualified","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"that could mean anything I am in undergrad with a 50 year old man who is gonna graduate next semester","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"they cant just throw them into the lions","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"just some would do better with others","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Well we can infer a little from dates of graduation about age","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Well a 50 year old man might have kids of his own","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Should age matter? Wouldn't that be discrimination?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"One is a masters student - he's the oldest ... most likely","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yes descrimination definitely","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yea age should not matter","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"definetly can't discriminate based on age","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i work for a recruiting office for northwestern mutual and we can no matter what ask about age or personal life","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"although perhaps someone younger may have more energy to deal with the kids","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but thats subjective","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"being that some people older than me have more energy than me haha","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I'm young but kids wear me out","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"would you prefer to have a 50 year old or a 20 year old working with your kids?","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"It depends","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"same here","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"but i think age tells you a bit more about character","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Sorry I am coming into this late. Are you debating Carla versus Emily?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"What if it's a 50 year old mom who has 5 kids of her own","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"it helps build your idea of the person","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"The 20 year old might know nothing about kids","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"were still debating between everyone pretty much","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"when i worked with kids we had older councelors that acted as the grandparents of the groups and really added to the atmosphere","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i thought we have settled between carla and robert","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"The posting says \"we value diversity!\"","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"they really were more respected, not as fun but more respected","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah i was a camp counselor and the older ones were more respected","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"by far","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"I don't think age really matters.. If your good with kids than thats all that matters at the end of the day.","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"what does robert have to bring again?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Why are you considering Robert? He has no experience, nor shows any interest, in young children.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"He worked as a teaching assistant","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"My three year old went to camp this past summer and the main counselor was college age and the junior counselors were high school age","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"He worked in academia.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yes but you want diversity in the work place it matters if all your councilors are 20","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"When you work with kids in a camp, a lot of times you do educational activities","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"he has demonstrated an ability to lead as a TA","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I don't believe the job announcement said that diversity was the object. It was simply that there would not be discrimination.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Well it says diversity is valued","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"But I feel like jobs have to say that","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"exactly","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I work for a school aged care program at the moment and the employees ages range from 17-30... Not saying that someone older than that wouldnt be good for the job, it just seems they are more in charge of the actual office things","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but like i said, the demographics are different","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Sure, diversity is valued. But Robert is not equal in experience to Carla in this field.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"the ymca position will deal with 7-14 yr old","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Well as a teaching assistant he might work with kids of all ages","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"ok so who should we definitely eliminate?","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"good call josh","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"mark? any thoughts?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"he was my first eliminated","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I really don't think we should eliminate anyone before interviewing them","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Well, that is something that could be flushed out in an interview. But if this has to be decided without an interview, then you have to judge by what they state on their resumes.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"We have another hour to talk","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes very true","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"That's good.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"It never said we can't discuss how to improve the resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"Or how to move on after the resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"and plus you cant just interview everyone who send a resume, you gotta weed out the ones that are not sufficient for the job","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"exactly","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"That's true cinthia","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i agree with cinthia","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"ok - so i am ready to interview - let's role play ... any volunteers to be certain people for a chat interview?","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"We're only looking at 5 resumes but in real scenarios we'd probably be looking at much more","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":":-)","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"I know I came to this late, but I'm wondering how the others were eliminated so quickly.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I don't think it's possible to role play with the information we have","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"So if we were to weed them out than it seems as though the 3 we would interview would be Emily, Jason and Carla, right?","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"true","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i agree with cinthia. we have to be efficient and cut off those who dont meet what the job description says","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Jason?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"Sorry,","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"Robert","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"thats ok luke","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"we only interview those that have potential","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Or we can interview everyone","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"we cant interview everyone","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"They all seem responsible","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"It depends","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"If we only got 5 applicants, we could definitely interview all 5","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"If we got 100 applicants, then we'd have to narrow it down","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"For our purposes I think they gave us 5 because looking at 100 applicants would be ridiculous","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"If I was the person doing the interviews I would start by doing telephone interviews with each to get that additional information we don't have. Then choose the top two or three to bring in for interviews","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"exactly irene","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Well, what kinds of questions would we ask?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I think Mark's resume shows absolutely no interest in this job. His background is biology and fundraising. Are we all agreed, and that's 9 of us, that Mark is eliminated.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"yea","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I guess we can","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i think mark was a bad candidate","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yea marks out of the discussion","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Okay","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"7\/9 agree i think unless i cant count","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"whose next to be eliminated?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"As for Richard, he has tutored students in grades 3-5 in science. That seems to be about his only experience related to this.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Mark did work with the new student orientation","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yea and he said that his hours are flexible","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"rita, how do you think that that relates to the YMCA position?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"New Student Orientation could be any ages","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"*age","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"yea and its directly dealing with kids","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But he did not tailor his resume to let us know that the ages were the same range, so should we assume that they are different?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"i agree with tia","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Well, Robert worked with college age students and you like him ... Mark apparently worked with some college freshman too","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"he didnt really make it clear that qualified him","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"no we shouldnt. but i never had new student orientation in elementary or middle school","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"so i would assume its college","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I asked why Mark was being considered. I am not in favor of him.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"me either","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I'm definitely not in favor of Mark","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"same","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But I think it would be wrong to eliminate him completely before properly interviewing him","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I am playing devils advocate ... Mark's out","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Hahah I agree with rita","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I also am not in favor of Robert. His resume, in my opinion, clearly indicates to me that he is interested in college age students and academia.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I mean if we're really picking at it","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well you cant interview everyone and we arent going to be interviewing anyone anyway","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Carla has grammar problems in her resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I thought Robert seemed better than Richard","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"tia, that was what the point i was trying to make","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"we only have the resumes to look at","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Richard was the least impressive to me","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"But one thing I liked about him","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"He mentioned that he's flexible","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"College age students studying like English literature ... not education or communications or sports management","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"And the posting said that you need to be flexible","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"What if Carla is only available one day per week?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Yeah, his flexibility seemed appealing","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Yea, they all probably should have put down times available","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"man if i were hiring i would just wait for more applicants","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but we really cannot even make a decision without knowing everything we need to know","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"these guys really suck","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"The most important thing is for the person we hire to work well with the children in the program, and to meet the goals of the program.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I agree with ariel","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Yeah they should have mentioned their availablity","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"because without all the criteria we could make the wrong decision based on experience but they cant work certain days and what not","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yep","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But than again, I would think if they are applying for a job that states you need to be available Mon-Fri from 4-8 than they would be available","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"You'd be surprised","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"alre we allowed to pick no one?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"We're allowed to do whatever we want","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"We have until 9:30","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"So we could discuss everything about this","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Yea some may think they only have to work one dya a week","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"It says \"various weekend shifts\" as well","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"It says the Mon-Fri 4-8 is mandatory","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"the schedule i guess would be determined in an interview","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"for weekends anyways","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"oh okay so they must think they have to work M-F","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Some jobs like to spring it on you","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Which is really annoying","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea the mon-fri is mandatory","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yea it is","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I've worked in retail and they have this call-in nonsense where you have to wait around and call an hour or two before to see if they need you","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"this really leaves way too much to interpretation... the post looks like it was written by captain vague and well to be honest none of the applicants seem much better","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"And this job might do that on weekends","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"me too irene!","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"worst thing ever!","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I agree melany","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I think they purposely made it all vague","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I think Carla is a strong candidate because she was a nanny for one year, has some learning in psychology, is CPR and 1st Aid certified, and has a clean driver's license (the latter meaning she might not have to rely on public transportation to get to work). I would assume, like it was mentioned earlier, that she would not be applying if she could not work out the hours.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It gives us more to talk about","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"who is captain vague? hah that was funny","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"haha. i think the description is vague as well","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"tia makes a good point","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I feel like the others may have similar qualifications as Carla","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but just dont mention it","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"idk why","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"havent we said before that carla is a good candidate","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"captain vague = the writer of the job discription","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I aree","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"some resumes r so vague","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think Emily is a strong candidate because she has a background in child care. As a marketing intern, she probably developed her communication skills. Also, she tailored her resume to state that her objective was to get this job.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"*I agree with melany","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I'm on a site that talks about resumes","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"link","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"We shouldn't be looking at any candidates who do not show interest in children in the age group of 7 to 14.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"None of them say they DONT have interest in those kids","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i agree with tia","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"They all mention kids at least once","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"then again i was a camp counselor and never had prior child care experience","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah, that's what I meant","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"When I said I was a Counselor In Training as my first job","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"That was my background for future jobs","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I worked with kids before I worked in retial","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"the demographics of whom the candidates had experience with matters","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"They teach you","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"It's not hard","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"They said they will have training","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"It really is a \"no-brainer\" type job, as long as you're responsible and willing to learn","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I agree with melany","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"jake- I was thinking about that too","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"When you don't have a background for the position you're looking for, you're supposed to do something with your resume to let them know why you want this job. And not because you need a job. But because this is something you're really looking for, and that you will not be a burden to your employer.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"However, some camps have counselors from different countries","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"tia has made a good point","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"However, Carla shows experience but she might be a mean person in real life","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"She might hate kids","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah she might be really shy or hard to deal with","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"how would you evaluate that irene","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I forgot who said this, but based on resumes, I wasn't really impressed either","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"An interview","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"It could be as simple as stating that I was one of twelve children, and I know all about dealing with children. Something as to why you and the job can be a match.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I think it would be wrong to pick someone based on a resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"And tia made another good point","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"we cant interview though","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"I noticed none of these candidates really made the point why they should be hired","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Which is the purpose of a resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"From what I could tell, we are supposed to pick based on the resumes.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yeah they didnt make very good points","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"how else would you narrow down who youll interview if you dont lok at their resume'","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"True","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i wish my roomates were here they both actually worked at the ymca","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Obviously, with the exception of Robert, these are younger people applying for the job.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"That's not necessarily obvious","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"One would not expect beautiful resumes from them.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"they would provide good input ariel","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"True, but I think we could all write better resumes","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"sorry about that i was disconnected..","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"The task is ... \"Your topic of discussion will be selecting one job candidate to interview from a list of resumes for a given job.\"","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Carla did write her interests though","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea so at the end of this we have to have someone","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"rita, I couldn't find that...so it's good you brought it up","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"what were the gramatical errors someone found in carlas resume?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"We just have to pick who gets an interview","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I don't know I feel like Carla awkwardly worded certain parts","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"don't look at me grammer is not my forte","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I feel like grammar might not be that big of an issue as a YMCA counselor? but i could be wrong...i just assumed writing wasn't that important for the job","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"The CPR\/1st Aid Certified is a big plus for Carla.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I think Carla has the most benefits","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"as do i","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"She would definitely be the best to interview","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I think we all agree on that","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"Yes","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yea","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But we have to talk until 9:30","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"She is definetly the top candidate","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I think we should talk about what we'd ask Carla during an interview","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"lol cant we ask for another topic?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"Doubtful","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"In the real world we would take like 15 minutes to pick two to have come for interviews .. done and over. In this exercise we have an hour and a half to beat it to death","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"...","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"LOL","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"That's true","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Who would be the next person we would ask to interview?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Well the way I would go about this is if you were to pick one of these people for your own children if you had them, what would you ask them?","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Good point luke","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Hmmmm....","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"Why don't we figure out what we'd ask Carla","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"good question","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Then pick our next choice","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"ok","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"good idea","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"And figure out what to ask them","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"I would ask Carla how she liked being a nanny, and why that position ended?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"or ask her what are the challenges she has had working with kids","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Good points","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"And also what she likes about working with kids","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"How about asking Carla how she does with multiple children","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Why does she want to work at YMCA","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"what was her most difficult child care experience (similar to jake's question)","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"how did she handle it","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"As Student House Council Vice President, it shows that she was picked to lea","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"why didnt she run for president?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Yea and what about her separates her from the others to be able to have this job","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"hey why does carla live in boston but want to work in albany?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I'd like to know what Lotus 1-2-3 is","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Good point ariel","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I would ask her why she became CPR\/1st aid certified? Seems to me that there might be some experience she had, maybe volunteer, that that was connected with and is not on her resume.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"what subjects did she tutor?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"She attends school in Albany","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Didn't she graduate?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}

{"text":"how long does she plan to stick around","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Good point","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"a masters can take as little as 2 years","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"why does she want to work with children if her focus is accouting?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"2008 - present","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"even less if you really pile it on","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"so graduation 2011","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"yea thats a very good question ariel.. most places are looking for a long term employee that the kids can get used to","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"well one thing that should be asked is if she can work the assigned hours and on various weekends","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"so do we want to hire someone if we dont know she is gonna stick around?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"we can also ask carla why shes interested in concentrating in psych, maybe she will maeke a connection with working with kids","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yeah good point","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I don't know if that is supposed to be a Master's.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"It states High School right before it.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Might be, as earlier pointed out, a messy resume.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Carla's high school concentration is psychology (I didn't know you could have a concentration in High School) anyway her college degree is in accounting","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"well either way you dont have to have a college degree for the job","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"definetly a messy resume","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Where's the BA or BS?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"yeah you could be in HS for this job","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"look here","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"link","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"we could also ask to speak with the family carla was a nanny for so we can ask them how she was and why she left","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Well if you're in high school then it might be awkward if the kid is 14 and you're 15","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"oh right i forgot the age group","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yea I think this job would have to be alteast 18 to qualify for","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i was thinking of the camp i worked out","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"haha my mistake","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"at*","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"that link was to help with what is an ma","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"sorry to be kinda random i should've labeld it :p","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well usually you have to be 18 or older to work with kids at the Y don't you?","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"ok sorry didnt see your post luke","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yeaaa","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"These people all have college experience so we don't have to worry about that","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"But it was kind of a good point - working with kids doesn't take a genius","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yeah","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"They all are qualified, some just more than others","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"If a thirteen year old can work with kids without relevant experience","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"(like I did)","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea all of the are most likely in their 20s","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Then how much do we need?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yes but you said you were a CIT right?","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"One of the things an employer looks for is to not hire someone only to have that someone leave within a couple of weeks. The employer wants someone to stay on.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I mean we should probably take into consideration that they are the lead counselor and they need full responsibility","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"yes i agree irene","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"well i was kind of thinking... like having someone who is more academically inclined might help because you do need to help kids with their homework i know that for sure since my room mate mentioned it","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Carla is probably the choice people pick without analyzing her resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think you may be the exception to the age rule irene","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Not really","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"There were lots of 13 year old CITS","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I just checked the YMCA website and camp counselors have to be at least 18 years of age","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"But I was under supervision","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"also i think its important to note that one of my room mates that actually worked at the ymca was a elementary school teacher.. and the other was a certified RN","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I'm still at Carla's resume, and how one jumps from HS to MA. Probably supposed to be BA.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well if you were a CIT... thats kind of a position where you dont need to have experience because that is the main job of training to become an actual couselor","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I think they purposely put someone like Carla to trick out","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"*us","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"She SEEMS the most qualified","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But she has flaws","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Location, availability, etc","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"actually tia i do want to mention that although perhaps your right there are programs at suny that allow you to take classes for both","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"She's \"too easy\"","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"If they all get training, they might be up to par or above par","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"at the same time and earn ba and ma simultaneously","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I can't imagine that that program is for the average student.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I wonder if Carla would be persuing this career long term","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"That might be true but it doesn't really matter what they have in my opinion","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Unless they're lying","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Which in that case they shouldn't get hte job","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"eh... we can pick no one at the end","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"as i said if it were me hiring","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I agree","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i would just wait for someone better","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"that someone better may never come","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i would probably just settle and pick carla","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Might as well interview her","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"depending on the demand","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It doesn't mean we have to hire her after the interview","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Why don't we begin over by agreeing what we are looking for in a candidate? Assume that the YMCA does not want quick turnover.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"We'd ask her about availability and such","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Do any of the candidates show a long-term commitment to any employment?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Its pretty hard to decide on these people just based on their resume... they could all be really great with kids but wed never know unless you met them and saw how their personalites were","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"in the end we need to select someone though","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"YMCA would want someone who likes children, available during hours, available for a wide range of time, etc","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i think it woulve helped if there was an availability form they filled out","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"It doesn't help to complain about the process we are using.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"hell i mean carla could be a really creepy lady","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"We're only allowed to interview one person","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i dont understand how availablity wasnt questioned","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Might as well pick Carla sine she seems the most qualified","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I just feel that she wouldn't get hired","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"It's set up this way because what we say to each other is being studied for a purpose.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But I think we all brought up good points","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I agree","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Obviously if we started talking about football or something then we'd be off topic","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"We overanalyzed all of them","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Agreed","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But we have another half hour","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"hey i wonder what kind of neighborhood did she work in? is it actually in existence and also what kind of neighborhood is her permanent residence like in boston?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I don't think we've overanalyzed.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"How far is Boston from Albany anyway?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Some people are crazy and travel every day","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"If the job starts at 4pm","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It's undoubtedly set up this way for us to be quizzical.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"2 hours by grey hound","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"She could spend her day driving","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"maybe 3","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I wonder if this is a real posting","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"me too","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"The other group is talking about Obama","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i hightly doubt that","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"I think we just have to accept that we are to pick one person to interview no matter what we would otherwise do in the \"real world.\"","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"We all clearly agree Carla is the best choice","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"It doesn't mean she'll get hired","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yes I think so","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Would anyone pick someone besides Carla?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"In the real world you can't interview every single applicant","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think Emily is also a strong candidate.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"instead of still talking about carla... maybe we could talk about why we wouldn't pick another candidate?","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I was really turned off by Robert when he said what the job could do for HIM","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"But I really liked his teaching assistant experience","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"people can relocate for a job though..if carla would move closer to the job area then she is definitely the best choice","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"And he was also participating in Drama which would probably mean he's entertaining","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I think Emily could defeat Carla if she had a better personalituy","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Emily didn't even really mention her experience with children at all","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Emily did child care.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"she would need to elaborate upon that","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"Definitely","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"she could have babysat once","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yeaa not really specific but its there","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"What would come out in any interview is more detail than is in any of these resumes.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah she could've babysat her cousin or something","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"But it says after school and on weekends","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yea it could be anything for her experience","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"which is what the job is looking for","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Plus she lives in Albany","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"could have been a lie","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"thats a plus","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"They all could be a lie","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"How is babysitting a cousin not relevant if she had responsibility and did a great job?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Well, dealing with any type of kids whether its family or someone elses it still useful experience to have","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"but why would they lie?","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"It didn't say who she provided care for, where, etc. So she could be making that up","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yeah just to get an interview","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"either way the employer will find out and they will be fired","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Fired? I'd just say not hired at all","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"unless she tells her cousin to lie for her or something","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"childcare is an extremely tight career and if you are untruthful you definitely get reprimanded","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i feel child care experience could be easily manipulated and embellished","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yes","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"future jobs can be at stake","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"thats why we dont interview those who didnt elaborate on their resumes","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Therefore we should interview none of them","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"coz theyre mad suspect","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Well I guess Carla we should","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yea.. without an interview we really dont know the specifics so by just basing it off the resumes you kind of have to go with it","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"It's their fault they didn't improve their resumes","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"There are plenty of sites that tell you how to create a resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Just google it","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"yea and thats all we have to choose from is there resumes","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yeaa","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Real employers aren't going to all be like, \"I bet they could possibly have a good personality!\"","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"hahaha exactly","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"They don't want to waste their time and efforts on who COULD be good","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"duhhh","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"yea they arent very good","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"something on paper needs to jump out at them","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"So in the real world, Carla would probably be the only one they'd care about","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Because she has qualities that stick out","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I think new job seekers have to be given a break. They can't be expected to have the wonderful resumes that come with experience. And that is experience that teaches one that it is okay to \"brag\" about what one has done.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"time + effort cost money'","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"It doesn't have to be wonderful","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"But for example","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"Carla wrote her interests","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"And those interests would most likely be done at camps","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"The other people might not have experience","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"and carla described what she did","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"personally if i had no experience then i would write something about why i think i would be a good candidate anyway","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"But they could've put something like enjoys arts and crafts, sports, etc","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"That's why I'm a bit hung up on Carla and the jump from H.S. to M.A. If she is older than I initially thought her to be (undergraduate age), then her resume should be much better.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"True","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Yeah I am curious about that as well","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I don't get why these things are an hour and a half","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"thats not true i mean someone could graduate at 17 and finish there masters by age 23","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"There are many ways to truthfully embellish a resume.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"thats not that old","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Age shouldn't be a factor","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"But there are years not accounted for on her resume.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i am 21 i dont have much experience with jobs because school is my main focus","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah same","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Before you graduate you should at least get an internship relating to what kind of job you want","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"And you could get credits for those","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yess easier said than done sometimes though","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"ariel, do you indicate the year you got your HS diploma? Dates you are in college? Dates you worked at a job?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I mean some of the people applying went to SUNY Albany which offers internships so they have no excuse","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"luke i have had three in the past two years","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i dont know if i could get an internship after college ...","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It's tough","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"not with my type of job espcially","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But I'm just saying, if you have NEVER had experience","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"it all depends","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"There are always places you could volunteer for free","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Especially relating to kids","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"3? very impressive you should be ready to jump into that real world cinthia","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"There's UKids on campus which allows you to work there for free for class credits","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yea places usually dont give interships if you graduate","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"This YMCA gig doesn't require prior experience so it would be considered an entry level position right?","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"Yes","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"and to answer you tia of course i would put all the dates down... im just saying there could be a reason","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Experience preferred but not necessary","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I think it is an entry level position","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I think it's definitely important to take into account empty dates","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Everyone needs to start somewhere","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Jobs definitely do that","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Yeah exactly","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"ariel, do you think the reason some people don't put the dates down is because they want to \"hide\" periods of unemployment, etc., so that they do not get initially screened out and have the opportunity to meet the employer face-to-face to explain?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"i agree that she should have put down that she is going for her ba and ma or that she finished it already","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"My first two jobs ever were babysitting and day camp junior counselor ... while I was in middle school","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"but i dont think we should knock her compleatly due to that","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"That's just something we can ask in an interview","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yeah sometimes people struggle with personal issues","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I'm not saying we should knock her completely. I'm thinking that we should further analyze.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"exactly","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"thats true","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah i agree","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But really, as long as they're willing to learn - for this type of job - training is given and whatever she doesn't know she can learn","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes very true","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Oh, luke to answer your original question ... Washington State ... no state income tax","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Maybe Carla didn't work because she had kids","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Hawaii","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"So with about 20 minutes left, are we definately set on a person or maybe 2 top people?","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"carla","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"hands down","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Carla is clearly our top choice","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"carla","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"ok good","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"It doesn't say we need a second choice","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"all in favor of carla say aye","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"But I guess we might as well","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"aye","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"aye","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"aye","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"AYEEEEEEEEEEEEEE","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"lol","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}

{"text":"hahhah josh","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":":-D","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"nah, only one person it said","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"but we still need to talk","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yeah carla","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"so we choose carla?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"si","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"hai!","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"congrats carla","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"What do you think they're looking for ?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Carla and Emily. But again, CPR and First Aid are definite pluses for Carla.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"For emily ... right - she's the red cross chick","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Oh yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"so she has experience in case something goes wrong","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yea..","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I feel like jobs just glance over resumes though","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Ooops Carla","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"So in real life, Carla would get the interview","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"sounds like it","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"sure","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yea i like carla for the interview","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I wonder if they were only looking to hire one person?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"does it say?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"lol this is gonna sound crazy but another room mate had volunteered for disaster relief and he had cpr training... but its expired now because it has to be re done every few years","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i know... i have 8 room mates :p","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Wow","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"Roommates or suitemates?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"i have 9 roommates","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"uhhh i live off campus in a big house so....","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"ohhhhh that makes sense","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Yes, they have to be re-certified CPR every few years.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"ditto it gets a little girl razy","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i think its every 2","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Could be.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"The red cross is one year, the american heart association is 2 years.","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"for cpr cert","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"oh wow","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"so she is no longer certified i bet","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"she could re test for it tho","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Guys, don't be so untrustworthy.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"besides i will tell you from talking to the paramedics at my emt class that cpr techniques do change","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so it is important","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"ive heard that too","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"expecially dealing with children","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Again, they all get training","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"The fact she has any experience is good","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"they have found better methods and such","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"The resumes are not the best in format, grammar, and style. But that doesn't make people liars. Hiding periods of unemployment, etc., is a normal acceptable technique; one just has to be on the look-out for it.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I still be anyone who gets hired for this job to work with youth will be required to do the trainning","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"* I still bet","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"yeah regardless of prior experience","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"If you were going to interview her, what do you think the most important question would be? Would you rather hire somebody who is OK with kids but available all the times or someone who is great but not available as much","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Depends on entire staffing","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i'd choose the most available","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"and if ever theyre mad suspect for leaving out info on their resumes, then we can ask them in the interview","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"what does this \"training\" include? i mean its costly to train people for cpr and first aid","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"thats just what i've experienced while interviewing","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"especially if you have a high turn over rate","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"they usually pick the most available","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"In this economy you have the ability to get both","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"then again it depends on the job","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"sometimes with training... the person pays for it or their job pays them hourly depending on how much it is since they are doing it for work","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yeah i got paid for my training","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"samsies","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"me too","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"So, are we agreeing that we need someone who will stick with the job?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"Well we don't know if Carla will stick or not","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"She might","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"If so, the job has to be a good match for the person.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I think we should stick with who's the most qualified and go on from there","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"well at least the person needs to be able to complete the hours","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"they do","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"True","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Would you stick at a job that did not use your skills, required you to develop skills you did not foresee any future need for, and have you around kids that you find annoying?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Availability is a big deal ... when you are new at any job you will not get far unless you bend over to meet their schedule.","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i agree","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"They're all getting training","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Would you be taking the first opportunity to leave the job at the YMCA for a better job?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"the more available you are the more likely you are to absorb good experience","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"or a bad one... ;-)","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"well if someone needs money and theres a job that they think they can get they may take it even if they dont like it... which is pretty common actually","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yea and you never know if someone is going to leave a job","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"7 to 14 is not an easy age group","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"anything can happen","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i agree","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"they are difficult","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"that really isn't something the employer can infer at an interview ... if you will leave","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"there is always that risk","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"at least we decided on carla","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"ya they can ask trick questions though like where do you see yourself in 5 years","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Hahhaah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"yeaa","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I think we should round up and say it's 9:30","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"How do we get the $10?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Hmmm a gold medalist in the 2014 olymipcs","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I think they pay us at the end of the study","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"in 5 years","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"ooooo $10!!!!!!","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"in a check","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"they count all the hours up at the end of the month and u get a check","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"oh its the end of the month?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"yup","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"great","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"So, I guess it's Carla to be interviewed.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"Yeah'","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"after all of the online sessions","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i wonder if they take into account that we may be a minority due to the fact that we are doing this for money","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I see","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"What do you mean ariel","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"what","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"well for example we have to value money","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"for one","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"and not have enough","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"or want more","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"enough in order to be willing to do this for money","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Yeah but we still have to discuss the topic","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"true","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"We didn't choose the topics","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"We all had valid points","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"lol well its a good thing theres about 4 minutes left cause this topic has run its course","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But we're all Albany students","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"It's all part of the statistical variables of the study ... right?","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"yeah but dont our ethical values impact how we would discuss a topic such as this?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"So it could technically not be a representative sample","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yes i think so","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"UAlbany students, certain age group, etc","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"and background and experience","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"and age","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i think they just needed participants","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yes exactly irene!","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"And maybe some of us wouldn't have picked Carla if other didn't say so","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Or if others didn't make points","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I certainly didn't think of Emily as a choice","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"tru","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"We're apparently one of eight centers doing this study","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"Oh OK even better..","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":" You have to select, as a group, one job candidate from the candidate below for the given job.","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"Correct, it does not mention any computer skills required","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"From the first look, who does everyone would be the most qualified?","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"ya rita thats corrext","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i have a quick question... when i signed on here there were two different chats open or so i thought so... i just picked a random one is that ok?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Do computer skills fall into the category of strong communication skills?","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I think Carla and Robert have the most relevant experience for the job","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"go to your email... it tells u what chat you are in","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"However, I think they're the least profession","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i see kk","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"*professional","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"i agree with u irene","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Carla has CPR training which I think is extremely helpful for a counselor","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i agree about carla","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I think that Carla is the best","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"not sure about roberth though","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"Well Robert was a teaching assistant","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I don't like how he started saying how the job could help HIM","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"You're supposed to say how you can help the job","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i debated between robert and emily for second place","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"hmmm i didnt get an email with a group specified","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"Carla has worked with kids up to 6 years old and Robert works with College students - the target audience is 7-14 year olds. That doesn't mean they wouldn't be good though.","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well why i wasnt sure about robert was that who was he teaching?","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"hello","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Conventional-Opening"}
{"text":"this is true carla","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"That's true rita","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Emily said she had experience with \"child care\" and said nothing else about it","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he could still be good but I myself have worked with kids before and you have to know a good amount about the age group","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I still think carla is the most qualified","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yea, I think it would be a lot easier for Carla to go right into this type of job compared to Robert who would have to make a pretty quick transition","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i only considered emily because she mentioned child care, majored in communications, and had experience with the red cross","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i still think carla is the best","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah I think so too","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"definitely carla... have we ruled all the others out besides carla, robert, and emily?","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"i agree with melany","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"She also has hobbies that are relevant to teenagers","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Richard at first glance seemed the worst qualified i thought","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I was personally only really interested with Carla and Robert","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Richard's resume was easy to read","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Richard was the only one who mentioned he was flexible","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"carla seem to understand what it takes to take care of a 6 yr old.","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah, Carla also has leadership experience as a student council vice president","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"The posting said the person must be flexible","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i especially like that she described what she did with takin care of the child","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Richard and Mark seemed more business-like","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Carla didn't mention her GPA but I don't think teens really care about her GPA","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well it doesnt ask for college degree","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"I think an interview would be necessary for all of these candidates","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think the only good things about Richard was his flexible schedule and previous tutoring experience","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yea and others resumes really didn't have much in them that are needed to do such a job like this","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"None of them seemed horrible","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Richard wants to work in a corporate setting ... sounds like. And Mark's experience is more to do with fundraising. Neither have skills with kids listed.","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea i dont think the gpa really matters that much as long as someone has good experience","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I agree with rita","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"so, right now, who have we said that we like? its down to carla and who?","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I think the most important thing for a job is experience, rather than GPA and other jobs you've had","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah i have to agree","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Robert and Carla","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i agree, experience is the most important facor","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yea","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"when you apply for a job what is most important is providing relevant information","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"okay.. i vote for carla","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"it shows that you care and are truly intrested","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i also vote for carla","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"It says experience \"preferred\" not required","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"That's true","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Again, wouldn't an interview be necessary?'","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"I think it should be between robert and carla though","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"They should all have interviews","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"hey she has a cpr\/ first aid cert","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"carla i mean","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think robert would be responsible but not as \"into\" the position as carla","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"thats really important","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"true","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"How about references. Talking to their past supervisors might be helpful","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"Oh yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"No one included references","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Yeah an interview is necessary","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"carla could have a terrible personality","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"However, the job posting didn't ask for references","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"this is true","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"true","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"exactly.. usually with a resume you don't post them unless asked too","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i think robert's experience is more of a \"teacher\" like description. the demographics that he worked with is not what the ymca position entails","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But when it comes to working with children.. someone who has experience with them opposed to someone who has not is more likely to get the job because it really does take time to know how to act and build up a lot of patience","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"thats true luke","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"That's true","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But again I think we need an interview","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"yes luke you really have to not be so much of professional but more or less be a role model","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"They could write whatever they want, but they could be really awkward in person","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes i agree","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yea you cant really judge a person on paper that well","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"based on solely resumes, who would everyone pick?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Carla","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"carla definitely","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"experience is the most important..they will deal with the kids alot better than someone without any experience","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Right cinthia thats the word I was looking for Role Model and almost an extension to their parents","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"It says children ages 7-14 so they are also dealing with younger children","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i would choose carla as well","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"It seems based on the job description - Emily with the communications major and the child care experience is a front runner with the information provided - I do wish she had elaborated on her child care experience","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I am currently taking a emt class and i can tell you that the leading cause of death for children is respiratory arrest","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes i agree","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"ya... and the age group robert has an experience with is not the same as what the ymca position is asking for","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i was torn between emily and carla","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i wish she elaborated as well","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think having CPR skills is really helpful","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"she could have more experience than carla","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"rita.. i did not even really consider emily until you said that","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and her red cross experience is helpful","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeaa me neither","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"what are the differences between emily and carla?","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"yea but it does not say what age group emily was involved with","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"there's not much description in her resume","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I think it's impossible to make the correct decision simply based on a resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"besides her marketing experience","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think the red cross experience is important - but anyone hired for this job will probably have to undergo training ... ergo if she has it already ...","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"Even the job description is a bit vgue","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"*vague","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"i dont like emily's resume","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Carla cared for one single girl as opposed to Emily who put child care which could be more than one person and also could have been a different job related to this one","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i dont either","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"and no one listed their work availability, unless i missed that?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"so? I mean emily doesnt seem put together enough to me","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"The job posting says they will get training","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"They might all be qualified","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"if she really wanted the job she could have put more effort into her resume","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i agree with ariel","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"My first job I've ever had was a CIT at age 13","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"emily's resume is bare","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I didn't get a paid job until I was 16","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"whats a CIT?","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Counselor in Training","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I was supervised by other counselors too","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But there were times if a bunch of kids had to go to the bathroom, I'd be watching a bunch of kids on my own for a few minutes","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"you know i really wish we had some ages for these people","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"really? even though you were so young?","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"So my point is...when working with kids, you don't really need experience","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"you just need to be responsible","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Well they all seem to be graduates of college","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I agree with melany","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"The resumes did show responsibility","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and besides, im sure YMca will give them some training","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"All of them","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"they all seem pretty responsible to me","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think they are all qualified","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"that could mean anything I am in undergrad with a 50 year old man who is gonna graduate next semester","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"they cant just throw them into the lions","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"just some would do better with others","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Well we can infer a little from dates of graduation about age","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Well a 50 year old man might have kids of his own","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Should age matter? Wouldn't that be discrimination?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"One is a masters student - he's the oldest ... most likely","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes descrimination definitely","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yea age should not matter","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"definetly can't discriminate based on age","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i work for a recruiting office for northwestern mutual and we can no matter what ask about age or personal life","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"although perhaps someone younger may have more energy to deal with the kids","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"but thats subjective","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"being that some people older than me have more energy than me haha","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I'm young but kids wear me out","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"would you prefer to have a 50 year old or a 20 year old working with your kids?","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"It depends","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"same here","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"but i think age tells you a bit more about character","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Sorry I am coming into this late. Are you debating Carla versus Emily?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"What if it's a 50 year old mom who has 5 kids of her own","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"it helps build your idea of the person","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"The 20 year old might know nothing about kids","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"were still debating between everyone pretty much","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"when i worked with kids we had older councelors that acted as the grandparents of the groups and really added to the atmosphere","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i thought we have settled between carla and robert","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"The posting says \"we value diversity!\"","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"they really were more respected, not as fun but more respected","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah i was a camp counselor and the older ones were more respected","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"by far","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I don't think age really matters.. If your good with kids than thats all that matters at the end of the day.","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"what does robert have to bring again?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Why are you considering Robert? He has no experience, nor shows any interest, in young children.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"He worked as a teaching assistant","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"My three year old went to camp this past summer and the main counselor was college age and the junior counselors were high school age","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"He worked in academia.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yes but you want diversity in the work place it matters if all your councilors are 20","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"When you work with kids in a camp, a lot of times you do educational activities","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he has demonstrated an ability to lead as a TA","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I don't believe the job announcement said that diversity was the object. It was simply that there would not be discrimination.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"Well it says diversity is valued","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"But I feel like jobs have to say that","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"exactly","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I work for a school aged care program at the moment and the employees ages range from 17-30... Not saying that someone older than that wouldnt be good for the job, it just seems they are more in charge of the actual office things","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but like i said, the demographics are different","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"Sure, diversity is valued. But Robert is not equal in experience to Carla in this field.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"the ymca position will deal with 7-14 yr old","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Well as a teaching assistant he might work with kids of all ages","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"ok so who should we definitely eliminate?","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"good call josh","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"mark?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":" any thoughts?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"he was my first eliminated","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I really don't think we should eliminate anyone before interviewing them","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Well, that is something that could be flushed out in an interview. But if this has to be decided without an interview, then you have to judge by what they state on their resumes.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"We have another hour to talk","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes very true","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"That's good.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"It never said we can't discuss how to improve the resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Or how to move on after the resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and plus you cant just interview everyone who send a resume, you gotta weed out the ones that are not sufficient for the job","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"exactly","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"That's true cinthia","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i agree with cinthia","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"ok - so i am ready to interview - let's role play ... any volunteers to be certain people for a chat interview?","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"We're only looking at 5 resumes but in real scenarios we'd probably be looking at much more","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":":-)","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"I know I came to this late, but I'm wondering how the others were eliminated so quickly.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I don't think it's possible to role play with the information we have","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"So if we were to weed them out than it seems as though the 3 we would interview would be Emily, Jason and Carla, right?","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"true","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i agree with cinthia.","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":" we have to be efficient and cut off those who dont meet what the job description says","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Jason?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Signal-Non-Understanding"}
{"text":"Sorry, Robert","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"thats ok luke","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"we only interview those that have potential","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Or we can interview everyone","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"we cant interview everyone","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"They all seem responsible","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It depends","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"If we only got 5 applicants, we could definitely interview all 5","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"If we got 100 applicants, then we'd have to narrow it down","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"For our purposes I think they gave us 5 because looking at 100 applicants would be ridiculous","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"If I was the person doing the interviews I would start by doing telephone interviews with each to get that additional information we don't have. Then choose the top two or three to bring in for interviews","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"exactly irene","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Well, what kinds of questions would we ask?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I think Mark's resume shows absolutely no interest in this job. His background is biology and fundraising. Are we all agreed, and that's 9 of us, that Mark is eliminated.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"yea","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I guess we can","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i think mark was a bad candidate","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yea marks out of the discussion","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Okay","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"7\/9 agree i think unless i cant count","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"whose next to be eliminated?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"As for Richard, he has tutored students in grades 3-5 in science. That seems to be about his only experience related to this.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Mark did work with the new student orientation","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"yea and he said that his hours are flexible","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"rita, how do you think that that relates to the YMCA position?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"New Student Orientation could be any ages","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"*age","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"yea and its directly dealing with kids","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But he did not tailor his resume to let us know that the ages were the same range, so should we assume that they are different?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"i agree with tia","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Well, Robert worked with college age students and you like him ... Mark apparently worked with some college freshman too","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"he didnt really make it clear that qualified him","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"no we shouldnt. but i never had new student orientation in elementary or middle school","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"so i would assume its college","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I asked why Mark was being considered. I am not in favor of him.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"me either","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I'm definitely not in favor of Mark","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"same","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But I think it would be wrong to eliminate him completely before properly interviewing him","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I am playing devils advocate ... Mark's out","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Hahah I agree with rita","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I also am not in favor of Robert. His resume, in my opinion, clearly indicates to me that he is interested in college age students and academia.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I mean if we're really picking at it","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"well you cant interview everyone and we arent going to be interviewing anyone anyway","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"Carla has grammar problems in her resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I thought Robert seemed better than Richard","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"tia, that was what the point i was trying to make","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"we only have the resumes to look at","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Richard was the least impressive to me","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But one thing I liked about him","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"He mentioned that he's flexible","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"College age students studying like English literature ... not education or communications or sports management","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"And the posting said that you need to be flexible","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"What if Carla is only available one day per week?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Yeah, his flexibility seemed appealing","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Yea, they all probably should have put down times available","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"man if i were hiring i would just wait for more applicants","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but we really cannot even make a decision without knowing everything we need to know","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"these guys really suck","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"The most important thing is for the person we hire to work well with the children in the program, and to meet the goals of the program.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I agree with ariel","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Yeah they should have mentioned their availablity","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"because without all the criteria we could make the wrong decision based on experience but they cant work certain days and what not","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yep","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But than again, I would think if they are applying for a job that states you need to be available Mon-Fri from 4-8 than they would be available","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"You'd be surprised","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"alre we allowed to pick no one?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"We're allowed to do whatever we want","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"We have until 9:30","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"So we could discuss everything about this","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yea some may think they only have to work one dya a week","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"It says \"various weekend shifts\" as well","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It says the Mon-Fri 4-8 is mandatory","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"the schedule i guess would be determined in an interview","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"for weekends anyways","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"oh okay so they must think they have to work M-F","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Some jobs like to spring it on you","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Which is really annoying","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea the mon-fri is mandatory","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yea it is","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I've worked in retail and they have this call-in nonsense where you have to wait around and call an hour or two before to see if they need you","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"this really leaves way too much to interpretation... the post looks like it was written by captain vague and well to be honest none of the applicants seem much better","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"And this job might do that on weekends","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"me too irene!","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"worst thing ever!","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I agree melany","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I think they purposely made it all vague","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think Carla is a strong candidate because she was a nanny for one year, has some learning in psychology, is CPR and 1st Aid certified, and has a clean driver's license (the latter meaning she might not have to rely on public transportation to get to work). I would assume, like it was mentioned earlier, that she would not be applying if she could not work out the hours.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It gives us more to talk about","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"who is captain vague? hah that was funny","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"haha. i think the description is vague as well","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"tia makes a good point","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I feel like the others may have similar qualifications as Carla","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but just dont mention it","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"idk why","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"havent we said before that carla is a good candidate","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"captain vague = the writer of the job discription","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I aree","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"some resumes r so vague","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think Emily is a strong candidate because she has a background in child care. As a marketing intern, she probably developed her communication skills. Also, she tailored her resume to state that her objective was to get this job.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"*I agree with melany","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"I'm on a site that talks about resumes","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"link","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"We shouldn't be looking at any candidates who do not show interest in children in the age group of 7 to 14.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"None of them say they DONT have interest in those kids","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i agree with tia","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"They all mention kids at least once","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"then again i was a camp counselor and never had prior child care experience","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah, that's what I meant","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"When I said I was a Counselor In Training as my first job","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"That was my background for future jobs","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I worked with kids before I worked in retial","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"the demographics of whom the candidates had experience with matters","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"They teach you","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"It's not hard","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"They said they will have training","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It really is a \"no-brainer\" type job, as long as you're responsible and willing to learn","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I agree with melany","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"jake- I was thinking about that too","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"When you don't have a background for the position you're looking for, you're supposed to do something with your resume to let them know why you want this job. And not because you need a job. But because this is something you're really looking for, and that you will not be a burden to your employer.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"However, some camps have counselors from different countries","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"tia has made a good point","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"However, Carla shows experience but she might be a mean person in real life","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"She might hate kids","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah she might be really shy or hard to deal with","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"how would you evaluate that irene","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I forgot who said this, but based on resumes, I wasn't really impressed either","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"An interview","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"It could be as simple as stating that I was one of twelve children, and I know all about dealing with children. Something as to why you and the job can be a match.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think it would be wrong to pick someone based on a resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"And tia made another good point","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"we cant interview though","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"I noticed none of these candidates really made the point why they should be hired","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Which is the purpose of a resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"From what I could tell, we are supposed to pick based on the resumes.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"yeah they didnt make very good points","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"how else would you narrow down who youll interview if you dont lok at their resume'","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"True","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"i wish my roomates were here they both actually worked at the ymca","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Obviously, with the exception of Robert, these are younger people applying for the job.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"That's not necessarily obvious","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"One would not expect beautiful resumes from them.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"they would provide good input ariel","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"True, but I think we could all write better resumes","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"sorry about that i was disconnected..","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"The task is ... \"Your topic of discussion will be selecting one job candidate to interview from a list of resumes for a given job.\"","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Carla did write her interests though","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea so at the end of this we have to have someone","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"rita, I couldn't find that...so it's good you brought it up","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"what were the gramatical errors someone found in carlas resume?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"We just have to pick who gets an interview","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I don't know I feel like Carla awkwardly worded certain parts","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"don't look at me grammer is not my forte","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"I feel like grammar might not be that big of an issue as a YMCA counselor? but i could be wrong...i just assumed writing wasn't that important for the job","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"The CPR\/1st Aid Certified is a big plus for Carla.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think Carla has the most benefits","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"as do i","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"She would definitely be the best to interview","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think we all agree on that","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"Yes","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yea","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But we have to talk until 9:30","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"She is definetly the top candidate","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I think we should talk about what we'd ask Carla during an interview","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"lol cant we ask for another topic?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"Doubtful","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"In the real world we would take like 15 minutes to pick two to have come for interviews .. done and over. In this exercise we have an hour and a half to beat it to death","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"...","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"LOL","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"That's true","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Who would be the next person we would ask to interview?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Well the way I would go about this is if you were to pick one of these people for your own children if you had them, what would you ask them?","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Good point luke","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"Hmmmm....","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"Why don't we figure out what we'd ask Carla","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"good question","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Then pick our next choice","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"ok","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"good idea","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"And figure out what to ask them","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"I would ask Carla how she liked being a nanny, and why that position ended?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"or ask her what are the challenges she has had working with kids","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Good points","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"And also what she likes about working with kids","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"How about asking Carla how she does with multiple children","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"Why does she want to work at YMCA","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"what was her most difficult child care experience (similar to jake's question)","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"how did she handle it","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"As Student House Council Vice President, it shows that she was picked to lea","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"why didnt she run for president?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yea and what about her separates her from the others to be able to have this job","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"hey why does carla live in boston but want to work in albany?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I'd like to know what Lotus 1-2-3 is","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Good point ariel","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I would ask her why she became CPR\/1st aid certified? Seems to me that there might be some experience she had, maybe volunteer, that that was connected with and is not on her resume.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"what subjects did she tutor?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"She attends school in Albany","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Didn't she graduate?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"nah she's still working on her masters in accounting","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"Ohh","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"how long does she plan to stick around","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Good point","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"a masters can take as little as 2 years","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"why does she want to work with children if her focus is accouting?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"2008 - present","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"even less if you really pile it on","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so graduation 2011","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea thats a very good question ariel.. most places are looking for a long term employee that the kids can get used to","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"well one thing that should be asked is if she can work the assigned hours and on various weekends","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"so do we want to hire someone if we dont know she is gonna stick around?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"we can also ask carla why shes interested in concentrating in psych, maybe she will maeke a connection with working with kids","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"yeah good point","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I don't know if that is supposed to be a Master's.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It states High School right before it.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Might be, as earlier pointed out, a messy resume.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Carla's high school concentration is psychology (I didn't know you could have a concentration in High School) anyway her college degree is in accounting","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well either way you dont have to have a college degree for the job","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"definetly a messy resume","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Where's the BA or BS?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"yeah you could be in HS for this job","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"look here","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"link","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"we could also ask to speak with the family carla was a nanny for so we can ask them how she was and why she left","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"Well if you're in high school then it might be awkward if the kid is 14 and you're 15","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"oh right i forgot the age group","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yea I think this job would have to be alteast 18 to qualify for","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i was thinking of the camp i worked out","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"haha my mistake","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"at*","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"that link was to help with what is an ma","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"sorry to be kinda random i should've labeld it :p","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well usually you have to be 18 or older to work with kids at the Y don't you?","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"ok sorry didnt see your post luke","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"yeaaa","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"These people all have college experience so we don't have to worry about that","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"But it was kind of a good point - working with kids doesn't take a genius","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeah","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"They all are qualified, some just more than others","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"If a thirteen year old can work with kids without relevant experience","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"(like I did)","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea all of the are most likely in their 20s","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Then how much do we need?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"yes but you said you were a CIT right?","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"One of the things an employer looks for is to not hire someone only to have that someone leave within a couple of weeks. The employer wants someone to stay on.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I mean we should probably take into consideration that they are the lead counselor and they need full responsibility","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes i agree irene","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"well i was kind of thinking... like having someone who is more academically inclined might help because you do need to help kids with their homework i know that for sure since my room mate mentioned it","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Carla is probably the choice people pick without analyzing her resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think you may be the exception to the age rule irene","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Not really","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"There were lots of 13 year old CITS","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I just checked the YMCA website and camp counselors have to be at least 18 years of age","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But I was under supervision","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"also i think its important to note that one of my room mates that actually worked at the ymca was a elementary school teacher.. and the other was a certified RN","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I'm still at Carla's resume, and how one jumps from HS to MA. Probably supposed to be BA.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well if you were a CIT... thats kind of a position where you dont need to have experience because that is the main job of training to become an actual couselor","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think they purposely put someone like Carla to trick out","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"*us","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"She SEEMS the most qualified","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But she has flaws","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Location, availability, etc","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"actually tia i do want to mention that although perhaps your right there are programs at suny that allow you to take classes for both","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"She's \"too easy\"","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"If they all get training, they might be up to par or above par","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"at the same time and earn ba and ma simultaneously","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I can't imagine that that program is for the average student.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"I wonder if Carla would be persuing this career long term","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"That might be true but it doesn't really matter what they have in my opinion","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"Unless they're lying","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Which in that case they shouldn't get hte job","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"eh... we can pick no one at the end","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"as i said if it were me hiring","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I agree","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i would just wait for someone better","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"that someone better may never come","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"i would probably just settle and pick carla","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"Might as well interview her","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"depending on the demand","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It doesn't mean we have to hire her after the interview","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Why don't we begin over by agreeing what we are looking for in a candidate? Assume that the YMCA does not want quick turnover.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"We'd ask her about availability and such","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Do any of the candidates show a long-term commitment to any employment?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Its pretty hard to decide on these people just based on their resume... they could all be really great with kids but wed never know unless you met them and saw how their personalites were","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"in the end we need to select someone though","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"YMCA would want someone who likes children, available during hours, available for a wide range of time, etc","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think it woulve helped if there was an availability form they filled out","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"It doesn't help to complain about the process we are using.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"hell i mean carla could be a really creepy lady","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"We're only allowed to interview one person","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i dont understand how availablity wasnt questioned","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Might as well pick Carla sine she seems the most qualified","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I just feel that she wouldn't get hired","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It's set up this way because what we say to each other is being studied for a purpose.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But I think we all brought up good points","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I agree","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Obviously if we started talking about football or something then we'd be off topic","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"We overanalyzed all of them","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Agreed","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But we have another half hour","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"hey i wonder what kind of neighborhood did she work in? is it actually in existence and also what kind of neighborhood is her permanent residence like in boston?","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I don't think we've overanalyzed.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"How far is Boston from Albany anyway?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Some people are crazy and travel every day","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"If the job starts at 4pm","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It's undoubtedly set up this way for us to be quizzical.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"2 hours by grey hound","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"She could spend her day driving","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"maybe 3","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I wonder if this is a real posting","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"me too","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"The other group is talking about Obama","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i hightly doubt that","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"I think we just have to accept that we are to pick one person to interview no matter what we would otherwise do in the \"real world.\"","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"We all clearly agree Carla is the best choice","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"It doesn't mean she'll get hired","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yes I think so","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Would anyone pick someone besides Carla?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"In the real world you can't interview every single applicant","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I think Emily is also a strong candidate.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"instead of still talking about carla... maybe we could talk about why we wouldn't pick another candidate?","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"I was really turned off by Robert when he said what the job could do for HIM","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"But I really liked his teaching assistant experience","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"people can relocate for a job though..if carla would move closer to the job area then she is definitely the best choice","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"And he was also participating in Drama which would probably mean he's entertaining","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think Emily could defeat Carla if she had a better personalituy","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Emily didn't even really mention her experience with children at all","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Emily did child care.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"she would need to elaborate upon that","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Definitely","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"she could have babysat once","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeaa not really specific but its there","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"What would come out in any interview is more detail than is in any of these resumes.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yeah she could've babysat her cousin or something","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But it says after school and on weekends","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea it could be anything for her experience","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"which is what the job is looking for","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Plus she lives in Albany","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"could have been a lie","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"thats a plus","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"They all could be a lie","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"How is babysitting a cousin not relevant if she had responsibility and did a great job?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Well, dealing with any type of kids whether its family or someone elses it still useful experience to have","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"but why would they lie?","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"It didn't say who she provided care for, where, etc. So she could be making that up","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yeah just to get an interview","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"either way the employer will find out and they will be fired","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Fired? I'd just say not hired at all","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"unless she tells her cousin to lie for her or something","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"yeah","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"childcare is an extremely tight career and if you are untruthful you definitely get reprimanded","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i feel child care experience could be easily manipulated and embellished","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Yes","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"future jobs can be at stake","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"thats why we dont interview those who didnt elaborate on their resumes","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Therefore we should interview none of them","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"coz theyre mad suspect","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Well I guess Carla we should","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"yea.. without an interview we really dont know the specifics so by just basing it off the resumes you kind of have to go with it","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"It's their fault they didn't improve their resumes","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"There are plenty of sites that tell you how to create a resume","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Just google it","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"yea and thats all we have to choose from is there resumes","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yeaa","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Real employers aren't going to all be like, \"I bet they could possibly have a good personality!\"","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"hahaha exactly","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"They don't want to waste their time and efforts on who COULD be good","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"duhhh","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yea they arent very good","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"something on paper needs to jump out at them","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"So in the real world, Carla would probably be the only one they'd care about","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Because she has qualities that stick out","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I think new job seekers have to be given a break. They can't be expected to have the wonderful resumes that come with experience. And that is experience that teaches one that it is okay to \"brag\" about what one has done.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"time + effort cost money'","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"It doesn't have to be wonderful","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But for example","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"Carla wrote her interests","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"And those interests would most likely be done at camps","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"The other people might not have experience","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and carla described what she did","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"personally if i had no experience then i would write something about why i think i would be a good candidate anyway","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But they could've put something like enjoys arts and crafts, sports, etc","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"That's why I'm a bit hung up on Carla and the jump from H.S. to M.A. If she is older than I initially thought her to be (undergraduate age), then her resume should be much better.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"True","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"Yeah I am curious about that as well","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I don't get why these things are an hour and a half","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"thats not true i mean someone could graduate at 17 and finish there masters by age 23","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"There are many ways to truthfully embellish a resume.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"thats not that old","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Age shouldn't be a factor","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But there are years not accounted for on her resume.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"i am 21 i dont have much experience with jobs because school is my main focus","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah same","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Before you graduate you should at least get an internship relating to what kind of job you want","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"And you could get credits for those","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"yess easier said than done sometimes though","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"ariel, do you indicate the year you got your HS diploma? Dates you are in college? Dates you worked at a job?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"I mean some of the people applying went to SUNY Albany which offers internships so they have no excuse","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"luke i have had three in the past two years","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"i dont know if i could get an internship after college ...","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"It's tough","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"not with my type of job espcially","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"But I'm just saying, if you have NEVER had experience","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"it all depends","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"There are always places you could volunteer for free","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Especially relating to kids","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"3? very impressive you should be ready to jump into that real world cinthia","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"There's UKids on campus which allows you to work there for free for class credits","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea places usually dont give interships if you graduate","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"This YMCA gig doesn't require prior experience so it would be considered an entry level position right?","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"Yes","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"and to answer you tia of course i would put all the dates down... im just saying there could be a reason","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Experience preferred but not necessary","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I think it is an entry level position","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I think it's definitely important to take into account empty dates","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Everyone needs to start somewhere","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Jobs definitely do that","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Yeah exactly","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"ariel, do you think the reason some people don't put the dates down is because they want to \"hide\" periods of unemployment, etc., so that they do not get initially screened out and have the opportunity to meet the employer face-to-face to explain?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"i agree that she should have put down that she is going for her ba and ma or that she finished it already","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"My first two jobs ever were babysitting and day camp junior counselor ... while I was in middle school","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but i dont think we should knock her compleatly due to that","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"That's just something we can ask in an interview","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yeah sometimes people struggle with personal issues","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I'm not saying we should knock her completely. I'm thinking that we should further analyze.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"exactly","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"thats true","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"yeah i agree","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"But really, as long as they're willing to learn - for this type of job - training is given and whatever she doesn't know she can learn","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes very true","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Oh, luke to answer your original question ... Washington State ... no state income tax","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Maybe Carla didn't work because she had kids","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Hawaii","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"So with about 20 minutes left, are we definately set on a person or maybe 2 top people?","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"carla","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"hands down","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Carla is clearly our top choice","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"carla","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"ok good","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"It doesn't say we need a second choice","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"all in favor of carla say aye","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"But I guess we might as well","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"aye","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"aye","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"aye","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"AYEEEEEEEEEEEEEE","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"lol","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"i","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Carla and Emily","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"hahhah josh","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":":-D","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"nah, only one person it said","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"but we still need to talk","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"yeah carla","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"so we choose carla?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"si","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"hai!","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"congrats carla","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"What do you think they're looking for ?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Carla and Emily. But again, CPR and First Aid are definite pluses for Carla.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"For emily ... right - she's the red cross chick","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Oh yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"so she has experience in case something goes wrong","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yea..","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I feel like jobs just glance over resumes though","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"Ooops Carla","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"So in real life, Carla would get the interview","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"sounds like it","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"sure","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"yea i like carla for the interview","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I wonder if they were only looking to hire one person?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"does it say?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"lol this is gonna sound crazy but another room mate had volunteered for disaster relief and he had cpr training... but its expired now because it has to be re done every few years","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i know... i have 8 room mates :p","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Wow","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"Roommates or suitemates?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"i have 9 roommates","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"uhhh i live off campus in a big house so....","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"ohhhhh that makes sense","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"Yes, they have to be re-certified CPR every few years.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"ditto it gets a little girl razy","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i think its every 2","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Could be.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"The red cross is one year, the american heart association is 2 years.","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"for cpr cert","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"oh wow","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"so she is no longer certified i bet","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"she could re test for it tho","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"Guys, don't be so untrustworthy.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"besides i will tell you from talking to the paramedics at my emt class that cpr techniques do change","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so it is important","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"ive heard that too","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"expecially dealing with children","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Again, they all get training","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"The fact she has any experience is good","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"they have found better methods and such","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"The resumes are not the best in format, grammar, and style. But that doesn't make people liars. Hiding periods of unemployment, etc., is a normal acceptable technique; one just has to be on the look-out for it.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I still be anyone who gets hired for this job to work with youth will be required to do the trainning","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"* I still bet","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"yeah regardless of prior experience","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"If you were going to interview her, what do you think the most important question would be? Would you rather hire somebody who is OK with kids but available all the times or someone who is great but not available as much","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Depends on entire staffing","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"i'd choose the most available","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"and if ever theyre mad suspect for leaving out info on their resumes, then we can ask them in the interview","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"what does this \"training\" include? i mean its costly to train people for cpr and first aid","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"thats just what i've experienced while interviewing","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"especially if you have a high turn over rate","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"they usually pick the most available","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"In this economy you have the ability to get both","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"then again it depends on the job","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"sometimes with training... the person pays for it or their job pays them hourly depending on how much it is since they are doing it for work","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah i got paid for my training","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"samsies","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"me too","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"So, are we agreeing that we need someone who will stick with the job?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"Well we don't know if Carla will stick or not","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"She might","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"If so, the job has to be a good match for the person.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"I think we should stick with who's the most qualified and go on from there","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"well at least the person needs to be able to complete the hours","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"they do","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"And the person has to have the ability to commit. Are these candidates too new to the world of work do have shown such a commitment in the past?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"yeaa its tough you need someone to be there for the hours but they also need to good at what they do","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Tough predicament","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"you dont want someone who sucks with kids but has a lot of free time so they can work 7 days a week haha","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"True","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Would you stick at a job that did not use your skills, required you to develop skills you did not foresee any future need for, and have you around kids that you find annoying?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Availability is a big deal ... when you are new at any job you will not get far unless you bend over to meet their schedule.","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"i agree","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"They're all getting training","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"Would you be taking the first opportunity to leave the job at the YMCA for a better job?","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"the more available you are the more likely you are to absorb good experience","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"or a bad one... ;-)","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"well if someone needs money and theres a job that they think they can get they may take it even if they dont like it... which is pretty common actually","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"yea and you never know if someone is going to leave a job","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"7 to 14 is not an easy age group","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"anything can happen","speaker":"josh","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i agree","speaker":"jake","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"they are difficult","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"that really isn't something the employer can infer at an interview ... if you will leave","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"there is always that risk","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"at least we decided on carla","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"ya they can ask trick questions though like where do you see yourself in 5 years","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"Hahhaah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Other-Conventional-Phrase"}
{"text":"yeaa","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I think we should round up and say it's 9:30","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"How do we get the $10?","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"Hmmm a gold medalist in the 2014 olymipcs","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"I think they pay us at the end of the study","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"in 5 years","speaker":"rita","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"ooooo $10!!!!!!","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"in a check","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"they count all the hours up at the end of the month and u get a check","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"oh its the end of the month?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"yup","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"great","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"So, I guess it's Carla to be interviewed.","speaker":"tia","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"Yeah'","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"after all of the online sessions","speaker":"luke","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i wonder if they take into account that we may be a minority due to the fact that we are doing this for money","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I see","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"What do you mean ariel","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"what","speaker":"cinthia","dialog_act":"Signal-Non-Understanding"}
{"text":"well for example we have to value money","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"for one","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"and not have enough","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"or want more","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"enough in order to be willing to do this for money","speaker":"ariel","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"Yeah but we still have to discuss the topic","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"true","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"We didn't choose the topics","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"yeah","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"does anyone have any initial feeling towards which city it should be?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"i picked chicago but i'm open to suggestions","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"all of them hosted the olympics except chicago","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"I really liked st. louis","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"and it didn't seem too bad","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"*still thinking*","speaker":"eva","dialog_act":"Acknowledge"}
{"text":"wasn't chicago the one where only 70% of peoplke supported having it there","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"i didnt have a preference, but reading through looked like some may have traffic issues","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"the locals, i mean","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"i picked chicago","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"chicago was in the running for what olymics recently?","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"winter olympics I think","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}

{"text":"really? i didn't know","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"i liked the village they proposed to build for it","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"why don't we go through each city and weigh the pros and cons","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"well they didn't win so might as well use it now","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"good idea meg","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"good idea meg","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"well we could start by looking at the criteria posted and just eliminate based on that","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"Yeah","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"ok let's start with climate- an easy one","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"well there's one factor not considered","speaker":"eva","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"they all look about the same in climate","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"we could go in order of city? or by what they offer","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"yes?","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"climate looks same, yes","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"order of city","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"it doesn't include how much tourists WANT to go to a particular city","speaker":"eva","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"there's no point in having the money if not a lot of people wnat to go there","speaker":"eva","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"that's true eva","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"all the cities are larger ones so all seem mediocre choices","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but there's a lot to be offered by each city though","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i agree","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i guess what i'm wondering is","speaker":"eva","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"ok lets start with the first one st. louis","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"It's a nice city","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"they hosted the 1994 olympics","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so i guess they know how to handle them?","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"i don't know much about st. louis","speaker":"eva","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"honestly, I drove through it a bit this summer, but the only problem was the fact that i64 wasn't done with its construction","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"1904, wasn't it?","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"that was a long time ago","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"good point- construction","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"oh right!","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"it's right next to the mississippi though","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and this is for '11","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"will it be done in 2011?","speaker":"eva","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"and it has some good attractions","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"and an olympic village","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well are we more concerned with impressing tourists or just the quality of the area itself","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"should be completely rebuilt by 2009","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"91 percent want them to host it","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"what iwas wondering was that the city had money *pledged* to the event, but if the facilities aren't built yet, that will take time","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"keeps it in the running then- but we'll keep in mind construction (but we dont know when its scheduled to end so it could be before '11?)","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well think back to the beijing olympics","speaker":"eva","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"they put a lot of money into it","speaker":"eva","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"but there was still a lot of issues","speaker":"eva","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"for the visitors","speaker":"eva","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"but they also were very nearly not finished in time","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"the construction is scheduled to end by dec 2009","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"so they have time","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"it's 2010 now","speaker":"eva","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yeah idk if it finished or not","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so its supposedly done","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"construction on the olympic facilities?","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"no on the i64 highway","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"or roads?","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"no, the highway 64","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"its one of the main roads","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but what about facilities?","speaker":"eva","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"doesn't say","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"how long does it take?","speaker":"eva","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"i'd assume we want whichever has the best facilities","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes, i was asking about facilities. money is pledged to it, but if they haven't started building facilities, that could be an issue","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Response-Non-Answer"}
{"text":"rather than the tourist areas","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"prob about a year","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"although the tourist areas shouldn't be TERRIBLE","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well it's more like","speaker":"eva","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"can it handle the traffic?","speaker":"eva","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"if this is hypothetical as the post states, then none of them will have facilities ready","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"enough hotels?","speaker":"eva","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so we might want to consider other issues?","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Action-Directive"}
{"text":"i agree mavy","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"macy*","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Correct-Misspelling"}
{"text":"but la hosted a previous olympics recently, ,so they woudl have facilities ready","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"thats true","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"good point","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"hotels is a good point...","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"didn't think of that","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"LA can feel unsafe tho","speaker":"eva","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"it's really spread out","speaker":"eva","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes, i thought crime should be a criteria","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"I don't think LA should host it again","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"isn't traffic terrible in la? very little public transport, ,from what i heard","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"I don't think it has the same tourist attractions as st louis and chicago","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"traffic is AWFUL","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"--Response-Answer"}
{"text":"i heard negative things about LA also from tourists who were there","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"i honestly don't know as much about the places other than what i read","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"so...strike LA from the list?","speaker":"eva","dialog_act":"Confirmation-Request"}
{"text":"ive only been to LA haha","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"i think so","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"hahaha I went to CA this summer and drove there and back so I saw a lot of the country","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"In a independent survey, public opinion registered 77% of the Los Angeles residents in favor of hosting the event.","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"in south central","speaker":"eva","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"but i guess that's bias because people in los angeles don't represent everyone else","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"that's the lowest public opinion","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"yes","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"that's not good","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}

{"text":"what about atlanta- tehy've hosted before","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":"they've hosted olympics there already so it shoudn't be 100% no","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i odubt they'd bring it up again unless it was at least successful at one point","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"most of them hosted before","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}

{"text":"how do they nrmally pick cities?","speaker":"eva","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}

{"text":"what about st. louis","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Information-Request"}
{"text":", i agree with meg","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
{"text":"i think chicago is a better area than st louis from \"what ive heard\"","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"health is a great factor- bejiing had major issues","speaker":"macy","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"Well, if we're talking about crime and traffic, atlanta has really bad crime for pedestrians","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"i like that they have an olympic oaks village already in place to house athletes","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"st. louis, i mean","speaker":"lynn","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}

{"text":"I think it'd be easy to cross off la and atlanta based on traffic issues","speaker":"meg","dialog_act":"Assertion-Opinion"}
{"text":"well it might be different during hte olympics","speaker":"irene","dialog_act":"--Disagree-Reject"}
{"text":"yes definetly","speaker":"melany","dialog_act":"--Agree-Accept"}
