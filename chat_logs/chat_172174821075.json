They approach this subject with the same intensity and focus that they bring to their unexpected fascination with plastics. It's not just the material itself that captivates them but its transformative potential, its ability to be reshaped and repurposed much like their approach to life.\n\nAt the end of such days, Penelope unwinds in front of the television, indulging in a variety of shows that span genres as effortlessly as they switch from one topic of interest to another. This routine is complemented by an exploratory approach to food and drink, where each meal is an opportunity to discover something new or to refine a classic recipe with a personal twist. Their kitchen is a laboratory, a place for experimentation, where the fusion of flavors and textures serves as a metaphor for their life\u2014complex, nuanced, and infinitely fascinating.
