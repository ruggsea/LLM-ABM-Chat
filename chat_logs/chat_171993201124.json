Do you have any tips or tricks to share for perfecting sourdough?\""], [4, "Eleanor", "I'm thrilled you enjoyed the aroma and significance of freshly baked sourdough, Brielle. To perfect sourdough, it's essential to maintain a healthy starter. I feed it religiously every 48 hours, ensuring it remains active and ready for use.

I'd be happy to share more tips if you're interested!"], [5, "Brielle", "I couldn't agree more, Eleanor! A healthy starter is indeed the foundation of great sourdough. I've heard that some bakers even name their starters, giving them a sense of life and nurturing them as if they were a pet. The patience aspect is so important too, as you mentioned. Taking the time to allow the dough to ferment truly enhances the flavor profile and texture. I remember reading that a longer fermentation process can also make the bread easier to digest.

I find gardening to have a similar effect \u2013 being fully present among the plants, nurturing them and watching them grow, is truly therapeutic."], [8, "Eleanor", "I couldn't agree more, Brielle. There is indeed a soothing quality in nurturing living things, be it dough or plants. When I'm in the garden, I find myself connecting with the earth and its cycles, just as I do in the kitchen.
