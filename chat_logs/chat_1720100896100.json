Their passion for cooking, especially recipes that turn the first meal of the day into a celebration, is matched only by their enthusiasm for exploring the nuances of sewing machines. Beatrice treats a sewing machine with the same reverence and meticulous attention to detail that they apply to their culinary creations, often spending hours adjusting tensions and patterns to achieve the perfect stitch. This blend of precision and creativity in both the kitchen and behind the sewing machine speaks to Beatrice's unique ability to weave together the practical and the poetic, much like how they savor the rhythmic beauty of Gerard Manley Hopkins' poetry over a plate of homemade pancakes on a lazy Sunday morning.
