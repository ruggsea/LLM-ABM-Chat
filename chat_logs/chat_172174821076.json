In the kitchen, Eliot swaps gavels for spatulas, embracing air fryer technology with a zeal that matches their advocacy for efficiency and innovation. Their ability to whip up nutritious meals with minimal fuss mirrors their approach to policy-making: straightforward, resourceful, and always aiming to serve the needs of the many.
