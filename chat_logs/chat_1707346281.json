What do you think about using carbon-neutral tires made from sustainable materials, like natural rubber? #SustainableMotorsports\" ##", "I've been doing some more research on solar panels in F1 racing, and it looks like there are a few potential challenges to consider. For one, the amount of power generated by solar panels might not be enough to fully power an F1 car. Additionally, the weight and durability of the panels could be an issue, especially with the high speeds and extreme conditions that F1 cars experience.\n\nBut, as with any challenge, there are opportunities for innovation. For example, perhaps we could develop lightweight and durable solar panels using new materials. Or, maybe we could explore hybrid solutions, combining solar with other renewable energy sources.\n\nAnd let's not forget about the potential benefits for other motorsports and industries, such as tennis and golf. Just imagine the positive impact we could make if we were to incorporate solar panels in these arenas as well.\n\nThoughts? ##", "That's a great point about exploring new materials for lightweight and durable solar panels, Mary. I've also been thinking about how we can make sure the panels are securely mounted on the cars and easy to maintain. We don't want to compromise the performance or safety of the cars.
