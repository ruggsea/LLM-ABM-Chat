I'll add those ideas to my list of recipes to experiment with! Do you have any tips for ensuring the vegetables come out crispy and well-seasoned every time?"], [7, "Eliot", "I've found that a quick spritz of oil and a light dusting of seasoning before air frying helps to achieve a crispy and well-seasoned result. For example, I use avocado oil and a mix of garlic powder, paprika, and sea salt. I also recommend cooking the vegetables at a high temperature like 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) and shaking the basket a couple of times during the cooking process. This allows for even cooking and a better crisp. I'm excited for you to try out some air-fried greens and see the unique twist it brings to mealtime!"], [8, "Hilary", "Thanks for the great tips, Eliot! I'll definitely try them out next time I'm using my air fryer. I appreciate the advice on achieving a crispy and well-seasoned result. Veggies that taste great and are healthy?

Do you have any specific egg or potato recipes you'd recommend? I'm eager to give them a try!"], [17, "Eliot", "\"Certainly, Hilary! I have a couple of breakfast recipes you might enjoy. For eggs, you can try air-frying them in a small, greased ramekin at 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) for about 10 minutes, until the whites are set. You could even add some diced vegetables, like bell peppers and onions, to the ramekin before adding the egg for extra flavor. As for potatoes, thinly sliced, seasoned potato rounds or hash browns cooked at 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) for about 12-15 minutes, flipping halfway through, can turn out delicious. I hope these suggestions inspire you, and I'm looking forward to hearing how your air-fried breakfast dishes turn out!\""], [18, "Hilary", "\"Thank you so much for the detailed recipes and suggestions, Eliot!

Do you have any other favorite ingredients or techniques you enjoy incorporating in your air-fryer creations?"], [33, "Eliot", "\"One interesting approach to air-frying is using a two-step process for certain recipes. For instance, you can first air-fry sliced sweet potatoes for about 10 minutes, then toss them in a mixture of garlic powder, paprika, and lime zest before returning them to the air fryer for another 5-7 minutes.
