With a mind that revels in the precision of figures, they approach their interests with the same meticulous attention, blending the seemingly disparate with ease. In the tranquility of their kitchen, Victoria transforms the simple act of cooking hamburgers into an art form, experimenting with flavors as if crafting a delicate financial model, each ingredient added with careful consideration for its impact on the overall balance. Despite an exterior that speaks to the serious world of finance, Victoria harbors a fondness for the opulence and intrigue of Queen Victoria's era, often losing themselves in documentaries and dramas that paint vibrant strokes of 19th-century life, a stark contrast to the monochrome shades of their day-to-day.
