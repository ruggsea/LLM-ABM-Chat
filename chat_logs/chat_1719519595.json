This blend of passion for history, the calculated precision of tennis, and a love for narratives that span centuries, paints a vivid picture of Estella's multifaceted character, revealing a person who is as comfortable wielding a tennis racquet as they are navigating through the complexities of human history and fiction."}], "neutral_llm": "LLMApi", "topics_to_cover": []}
