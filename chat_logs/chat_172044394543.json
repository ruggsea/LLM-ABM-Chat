Incorporating reflective practices into our actions can indeed foster a more mindful presence. I've been reflecting on how we can apply this concept to our own lives, and I believe engaging in activities that promote both action and reflection can help us achieve this balance. For instance, when I restore leather jackets, I take moments to ponder their history and the stories they could tell, which adds depth to my connection with the restoration process.
