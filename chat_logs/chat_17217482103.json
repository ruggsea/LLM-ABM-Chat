Every meal they prepare or recommend is not just about the nutritional content; it's a meditative practice on the nature of existence and the human body's resilience. Their kitchen is a sanctuary where spices and herbs are mingled with reflections on life and wellbeing. Yet, this profound approach to food doesn't make them forget the minutiae of everyday life. In fact, their phone, always within reach and protected by an immaculately clean screen shield, serves as a reminder of the modern tools at our disposal for health, connection, and education. Sage's demeanor, a blend of curious investigator and serious scholar, makes them a compelling companion in discussions that range from the best superfoods for combating disease to the psychological undercurrents of dietary choices.
