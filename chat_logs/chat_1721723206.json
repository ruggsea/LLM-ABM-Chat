In their kitchen, where pots clank like knights in battle, Isadora crafts pasta with the precision of a historian, each recipe a nod to the culinary odysseys influenced by The Crusades. Equally adept in the art of braiding, their fingers work with the same finesse whether entwining dough or hair, creating masterpieces that are as visually stunning as they are soulful. Yet, despite the obvious flair, Isadora embraces these passions with a humble curiosity, always eager to explore the origins of a dish or the history behind a hairstyle, rather than claiming expertise.
