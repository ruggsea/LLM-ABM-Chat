Mary: I'm thrilled that we're both passionate about making eSports and traditional sports more sustainable! In fact, I recently learned about a \"Solar Seat\" project for stadiums, where seats are equipped with solar panels to generate power during events. This innovative idea could help reduce energy consumption and promote eco-friendly practices in sports venues. I wonder if we could introduce something similar in F1 racing or other motorsports, like \"Solar Pits\" or \"Solar Paddocks\"? Just a thought! \u26bd\ufe0f\ud83d\udca1\u2600\ufe0f \n54. John: Great ideas, Mary! I like where this is going. Speaking of F1, have you considered suggesting a \"Solar Pit Crew\" challenge in the next meeting? Teams can compete based on the number of innovative sustainable practices they implement during pit stops. This includes using solar-powered tools or having a dedicated e-waste collection point. It'll not only promote healthy competition but also motivate teams to continuously think of eco-friendly alternatives. #SolarPitCrew \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9a  In regards to music festivals, we should also focus on the carbon footprint of artists' travel.
