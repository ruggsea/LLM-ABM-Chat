Russian literature from the 19th century truly encapsulates the essence of its time, grappling with existential questions and offering a lens into society's complexities.

Alyosha's name does indeed have religious connotations in Christianity, particularly in Eastern Orthodox traditions. 'Alyosha' is a diminutive form of 'Alexei,' which is derived from 'Alexander.' In the religious context, it is often associated with Saint Alexis of Rome, a patron saint known for his piety and charity.
