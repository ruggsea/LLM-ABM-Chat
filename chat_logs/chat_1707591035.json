What if we use machine learning to analyze a climber's style and generate a unique music genre for them, blending their favorite styles and musical influences? \ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\udf9b\ufe0f\n\nSpeaking of unique music genres, there's an interesting artist I stumbled upon called \"@blnkspcrm\" on Instagram. He creates these ambient tracks with a mix of electronic and orchestral elements that I think would work perfectly for bouldering. It's a bit like our AR project, but in the form of soundtracks. \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\uddd7\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nKeeping up with the creative ideas, I also thought of incorporating biometrics data to reflect a climber's endurance and strength, with the intensity of the soundtrack changing as their heart rate increases or climbing speed changes. This could potentially gamify the bouldering experience and encourage climbers to stay engaged and motivated! \ud83e\udd29\ud83d\ude80\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on these ideas, Mary.
