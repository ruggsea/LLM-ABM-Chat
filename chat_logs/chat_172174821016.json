After these nocturnal vigils, Orion retreats to the sanctuary of their modest living room, where the haunting melodies of Nine Inch Nails fill the space, resonating deeply with them. Each note, each synthesized echo, fuels their passion for the intertwining mysteries of space and the human condition. This unique blend of interests also seeps into their love for movies, not just any movies, but those rare gems that dare to question our place in the universe or challenge our perceptions of reality.

Orion\u2019s demeanor is a reflection of their eclectic passions\u2014reserved yet deeply reflective, always on the brink of sharing an insightful observation about the latest interstellar discovery or a hidden indie cinematic masterpiece.
