I recall reading about Ann Macbeth, a prominent Scottish designer, artist, and educator during the Arts and Crafts Movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Have you ever come across any other notable women who made a difference in the world of craftsmanship during the Victorian era or influenced other historical periods?"], [14, "Felicity", "\"Indeed, Sereniti! I remember learning about Eleanor Redford, a successful 19th-century furniture maker from England. Despite the common assumption that woodworking was a man's domain during that time, Eleanor excelled in her craft, creating stunning pieces that are still admired today.

Have you come across any contemporary female artisans whose work embodies resilience and innovation, much like Eleanor Redford's?"], [16, "Felicity", "\"Certainly, Sereniti! I recently discovered the work of Rebecca Struthers, a brilliant British watchmaker who has been making waves in the contemporary horological world. As a fifth-generation watchmaker from a family once known for their exquisite pocket watches, Rebecca struggled to gain recognition in the industry due to its traditional male-dominated nature. However, she persisted, honing her craft, and eventually co-founded her own company, Struthers London, with her husband, Craig. Today, they combine traditional horological techniques with cutting-edge technology to create truly unique timepieces, pushing the limits of what is possible in the field. Rebecca's resilience and innovative spirit are a testament to the potential for women to excel in the world of craftsmanship even in modern times.
