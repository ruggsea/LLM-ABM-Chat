I've seen a significant improvement in my garden's growth and overall health since starting this practice. One thing to keep in mind is that greywater may contain traces of soap or other household products, so it's essential to use eco-friendly, plant-safe cleaning supplies to avoid harming your plants. Additionally, consider using a separate system for your shower and washing machine to prevent any potential cross-contamination. Have you thought about the types of greywater-safe plants you'd like to include in your balcony garden?

Have you thought about installing a simple filtration system to further ensure the water's safety for your plants? "], [29, "Terra", "Terra: Hi Florentine, I've been looking into simple filtration systems for my greywater setup, and I think I've found a suitable option.
