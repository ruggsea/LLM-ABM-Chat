The lunch breaks are often punctuated with spirited talks, not about the latest policies or campaigns, but about the subtle intricacies of Russian literature.

Despite the demanding pace of their environment, they remain a steadfast advocate for healthy eating, often seen exchanging processed snacks for wholesome, homemade alternatives.
