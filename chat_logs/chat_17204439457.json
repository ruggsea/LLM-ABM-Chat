Have you tried pickling any specific vegetables or have a favorite recipe to recommend?\""], [10, "Selene", "\"Averill, have you ever tried fermenting vegetables? It's similar to pickling but uses a natural fermentation process that can boost the probiotic content of your meals. A simple recipe I enjoy is mixing equal parts cabbage, carrots, and daikon radish, then massaging them with sea salt until they begin to soften and release their juices. After that, you can pack the vegetables tightly in a jar and cover them with their juices. Leave it at room temperature for about a week, checking daily to ensure the vegetables stay submerged. Once the fermentation is complete, move the jar to the refrigerator to slow down the process.

After breakfast, Averill steps outside, not into the bustle of city life but into the quiet of their garden, a sanctuary for the wild birds they passionately observe. With a keen eye and a patient spirit, they've come to recognize each visitor by song and feather, noting their comings and goings in a small, leather-bound journal that sits ever ready on the windowsill.
