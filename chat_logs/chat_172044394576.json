The film poignantly portrays the impact of tradition on emotional lives, forcing characters to navigate their relationships within these constraints.\""], [47, "Eliot", "Hilary, I think your insight about the lunchbox being an act of rebellion is spot on! It shows Ila's search for self-expression and autonomy within her traditional role.
