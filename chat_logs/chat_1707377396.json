I'm excited to see how we can continue to explore this connection through bouldering and music. Have you given any thought to other ways we can make our hobbies more sustainable? Let's keep the conversation going and see where our creativity takes us! Talk soon, Mary. ##\n\n###\nMary: Hey John, I've been loving the eco-friendly practices you've been incorporating into your bouldering sessions at BoulderWorld. Have you thought about hosting a \"sustainable jam session\" with some eco-friendly rhythms? I think it could be a great way to promote sustainability and have fun at the same time. Let's keep pushing the boundaries and see where our creativity takes us! Talk soon, Mary. ##"], "memories": [{"id": "65", "text": "1.
