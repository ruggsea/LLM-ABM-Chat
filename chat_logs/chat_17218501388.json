Policymaking can be quite rigid at times, but ultimately, laws should also evolve and adapt to societal changes.\n\n"], [30, "Senator Grace", "Laws certainly need a framework within which they can evolve. Without those initial parameters, it's easy to create confusion and unintended consequences.  \n\n"], [31, "Lila", "It's a fascinating comparison. Like a computer program, a society needs well-defined rules, yet the ability to update and patch those rules when necessary to remain functional and relevant. "], [32, "Senator Grace", "Just as code relies on logic to function, so too do laws need structure to be effective. But without the ability to adapt and incorporate new information, even the most elegant code becomes obsolete. \n"], [33, "Lila", "Absolutely.
