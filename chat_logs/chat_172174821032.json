But these hands are as adept at nurturing as they are at fixing; they coax life from the soil in a small but thriving vegetable garden, where Riley spends tranquil mornings among the greens. This sanctuary of growth is not just for them, however, as they dedicate a portion of each harvest to creating homemade treats for their canine companion. This four-legged friend eagerly awaits the fruits (and vegetables) of Riley's labor, a testament to the care and affection poured into every handcrafted morsel. And yet, despite these grounding hobbies, Riley finds joy in the whirlwind of shopping, always on the lookout for the best deals to support their passions. It\u2019s not just about acquisition for them; it's a treasure hunt for the perfect tool, the freshest produce, or the next big thing that will make their dog's tail wag with excitement.
