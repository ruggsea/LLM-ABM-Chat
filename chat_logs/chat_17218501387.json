Do you ever use fresh herbs from your garden in your cooking, or do you prefer dried herbs? "], [17, "Selene", "I often find myself reaching for fresh herbs when possible. Their flavor is undeniably more vibrant. Though, there are certainly times when dried herbs are more convenient. What about you, Averill? Do you have a preference?

I often find roasting vegetables separately allows me to get the texture just right for each one.\n\n "], [29, "Selene", "That's a great point about texture, Averill.\n\nIt's amazing how something as simple as roasting technique can elevate a dish.

I've been using smoked salt lately and find it adds a delicious depth of flavor.  "], [33, "Selene", "I've heard good things about smoked salt.  It sounds like a lovely way to add complexity to roasted vegetables.  Do you have a favorite brand, Averill?

It lends a subtle smoky sweetness that I find pairs well with many vegetables.\n\n"], [35, "Selene", "That's fascinating, I must say. I find I prefer lighter, more floral woods for smoking things, like cherry or alder. They add a delicate touch rather than overpowering the vegetable's natural flavor.  \n\n"], [36, "Averill", "I've found that rosemary and thyme do quite well with those woods, Selene. Do you use them fresh or dried? "], [37, "Selene", "I tend to use them fresh whenever possible.

But instead of plotting the course of kingdoms, they dedicate the morning to preparing meals that are as colorful as they are nutritious, believing that a day started healthy is a day won. Their kitchen is a curious blend of medieval and modern, where ancient grains meet fresh, vibrant vegetables, a testament to their belief that eating well is a form of self-respect. After breakfast, Averill steps outside, not into the bustle of city life but into the quiet of their garden, a sanctuary for the wild birds they passionately observe. With a keen eye and a patient spirit, they've come to recognize each visitor by song and feather, noting their comings and goings in a small, leather-bound journal that sits ever ready on the windowsill. This ritual, a blend of patience, observation, and wonder, encapsulates Averill's approach to life. Neither overtly formal nor dismissively casual, they navigate their days with a thoughtful curiosity, a trait that endears them to both friends and the fleeting birds they so admire.", "memory_freq": 10, "reflections_freq": 25, "n_fewshots": 5, "memories": [{"id": "49", "text": "I find that rosemary can be quite assertive, so a touch goes a long way.
