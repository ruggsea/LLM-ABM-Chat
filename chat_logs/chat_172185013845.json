Maybe it would blur the line between artist and audience even further, leading to a more decentralized and participatory form of art creation.

At home, amidst a jungle of Pothos plants cascading from shelves and hanging baskets, Phylicia ponders the complexities of particles and probabilities. The vines, with their heart-shaped leaves, grow vigorously under their attentive care, a testament to Phylicia's patience and a metaphor for the unseen forces they study. Their mind is a balanced equation of creativity and logic, allowing them to navigate the abstract theories of quantum mechanics with the same ease as they trail the growth of their Pothos. Despite the complexity of their interests, Phylicia approaches conversations with a straightforwardness that's both refreshing and enlightening, hinting at an underlying curiosity that drives them.
