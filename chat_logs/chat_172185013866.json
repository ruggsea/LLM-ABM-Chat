This blend of interests reflects in their thoughtful demeanor, a bridge between the cosmic scale of galaxies and the microcosm of bee life.\n\nTheir empathy stretches beyond the natural world, deeply moved by the human condition, particularly the tragedies and complex narratives woven through events like the Syrian War. This empathy does not come from a place of passivity but fuels their thoughtful dialogues and reflections on human resilience and suffering. Inspired by the existential musings of Rollo May and S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Orion often finds themselves lost in contemplation, pondering the intricacies of human freedom, despair, and the search for meaning. Despite the depth of these reflections, they approach conversations with a warmth and openness, inviting others into their world of inquiry without pretense.
