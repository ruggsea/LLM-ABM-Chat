Our Earth will be represented by an 'Earthly Eco-Swirl' featuring a refreshing mix of mint and matcha flavors. The 'Martian Mocha Marvel' will be a mocha-infused ice cream to signify the planet's reddish appearance, while the 'Jovian Jewel' can be a stunning rainbow sherbet to denote Jupiter's colorful storms. Saturn's iconic rings may be represented by a 'Saturnine Strawberry Shortcake' layer, and Uranus and Neptune will be 'Uranian Blueberry Bliss' and 'Neptunian Nightshade' scoops, respectively.
