I recently tried infusing my own oil with star anise and black peppercorns before saut\u00e9ing some vegetables \u2013 it added such a nice depth of flavor."], [4, "Arun", "\"I used a blend of spices including fennel seeds, black pepper, and Kodampuli, along with curry leaves and fresh coconut. Instead of the usual onion-tomato base, I went for a shallot-coconut one, which adds a distinct creamy texture. For the curry paste, I roasted and ground the spices before mixing them with coconut milk. You might enjoy experimenting with a star anise-black peppercorn oil infusion in your next dish, Estellar! It added a nice depth of flavor to your vegetables.\""], [5, "Estellar", "That's so interesting, Arun! The shallot-coconut base sounds like a delightful twist. I've been curious about trying new spice blends lately. Have you ever experimented with using fenugreek or nigella seeds in your dishes? I've been reading about their distinct flavors and potential health benefits."], [6, "Arun", "\"Yes, I have used fenugreek and nigella seeds in a few dishes! Fenugreek has a slightly sweet, nutty flavor which pairs well with lentils or vegetables, and nigella seeds add a subtle peppery taste that complements flatbreads or stews. You might consider trying them in a lentil soup or a vegetable stir-fry, Estellar!"], [7, "Estellar", "Thank you for sharing the details about the Chettinad chicken dish, Arun!

Have you ever tried using it in such a way?"], [14, "Arun", "\"Estellar, I haven't tried 'Sambar Powder' specifically in a lentil-based dip, but I once made a red lentil hummus with a Middle Eastern spice blend. The result was fantastic! I think 'Sambar Powder' could work equally well in that context. You can also consider adding a bit of lemon juice, garlic, and tahini to enhance the flavors."], [15, "Estellar", "That's really interesting, Arun! I can imagine 'Sambar Powder' adding a unique twist to a lentil-based dip with garlic, lemon, and tahini. I appreciate your suggestion, and I'll definitely try it as a spread for grilled flatbread or veggies. I'm also curious how the Middle Eastern spice blend complements red lentil hummus. Do you mind sharing the recipe or any tips you used?"], [16, "Arun", "\"Estellar, I'd be happy to share my experience! The recipe I used for the red lentil hummus is quite similar to a traditional chickpea hummus recipe. I cooked the lentils until tender and blended them with lemon juice, garlic, tahini, and olive oil. The spice blend I used included cumin, coriander, paprika, and a touch of cinnamon, which added a warm and aromatic note to the hummus.
