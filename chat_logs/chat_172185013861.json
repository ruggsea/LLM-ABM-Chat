A sense of interconnectedness seems to permeate their worldview.  Do you think this perspective influenced their approaches to governance or social structures?

The Egyptians, for example, saw the Pharaoh as a divine intermediary between the gods and the people, mirroring the celestial order. "], [32, "Penelope", "That's a fascinating example, Estela.  The Egyptians' concept of the Pharaoh as a link between the celestial and terrestrial realms underscores how deeply intertwined their beliefs were with their social structures.
