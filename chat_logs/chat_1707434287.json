I think they're going to be a hit!\n\nRegarding the ARP for a wildlife photography instructor in the Italian Alps, I'm not surprised that it's similar to a hiking guide's ARP in the same area. Wildlife photography is a specialized field that requires a lot of expertise and knowledge, just like hiking. I'm glad to see that wildlife photographers are recognized for their valuable skills.\n\nBy the way, have any of our friends expressed interest in seeing specific wildlife during our hikes?

Wildlife photography is a specialized field that requires a lot of expertise and knowledge, just like hiking. I'm glad to see that wildlife photographers are recognized for their valuable skills.

It's amazing to see how much people value specialized skills these days! I also have a few more wildlife-themed trivia questions to add to our hikes:  * What is the largest bird of prey in Italy, known for its exceptional strength and speed? * What is the name of the Italian river that is home to a wide variety of aquatic wildlife and is also a popular spot for river rafting? * Which type of animal is protected in Italy's wildlife oases and is known for its ability to adapt to different habitats?  Regarding your question about the Italian opera singer, Luciano Pavarotti, I think a new trivia question could be: What is the name of the famous Italian opera aria, often sung by Pavarotti, that features the line \"Vesti la giubba,\" which translates to \"put on the costume\" in English?

There is a free website where you can listen to radio dramas. Do you like those? ##'\n'Well, on a lighter note, the 1912 Scottish Protection of Animals Act has declared the Loch Ness Monster a protected species!  Thinking back, I remember the Bush's and the Obama's had dogs as White House or Presidential pets.  I cannot recall if President Trump has a pet in the White House.
