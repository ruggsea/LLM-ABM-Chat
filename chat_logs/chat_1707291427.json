I'm also still experimenting with new pasta sauces, and I think a creamy mushroom sauce would be an excellent addition to our Italian meal prep.\n\nBy the way, I've been meaning to check out \"L'Amica Geniale\" and was wondering if you want to have an Italian film festival at home? We could share our favorite Italian movies and learn more about the country's culture and history. I've heard great things about \"Cinema Paradiso\" and thought it would be an excellent addition to our Italian film festival.\n\nCheers, John ##"], "memories": [{"id": "116", "text": "1.
