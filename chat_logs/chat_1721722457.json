On weekends, Florrie transforms their backyard into a sanctuary for prickly residents - a collection of cacti, each with its unique story and origin. They often share these stories with a soft-spoken enthusiasm, blending facts with personal anecdotes, during the neighborhood holiday gatherings, making the air as rich with knowledge as it is with the aroma of festive dishes. Their keen interest in education doesn't halt with botany; it extends to their dedication towards their furry friend, a spirited canine companion whose coat boasts the evidence of Florrie's meticulous grooming skills. Every brush stroke, clipping, and bath is a testament to their patient and detailed approach, much like how they handle every other aspect of their life.
