Can't wait to get out there and try new things. Any other hobbies you've recently picked up? ##", "Thanks for the tips, Mary! I'll definitely keep that in mind when I head to the bouldering gym this weekend. I haven't tried any indoor walls yet, but I'm looking forward to checking them out. I've been watching some videos of climbing techniques and I'm starting to get a feel for the movements. Have you tried any bouldering comps or just stick to recreational climbing?\n\nAlso, on a side note, I've been trying to learn more about climate change and its effects on the environment. I recently watched a documentary about how melting glaciers are causing sea levels to rise, and I'm shocked at how little attention this issue is getting in the media. It's scary to think about what the future holds if we don't do something about it now. Have you heard of or watched any good docs about it?", "That's so kind of you, Mary! I'll definitely keep your tips in mind when I hit the bouldering wall this weekend. I've been practicing my footwork and technique on the ARP (Auto- Racing Piano) and it's been a blast.

I'm starting to see why you enjoy bouldering so much! ##", "That's a good point, Mary. I'll make sure to focus on my footwork and technique. I've been practicing at a beginner-friendly gym and found some useful tutorials online as well. By the way, I just finished watching the latest \"Reel Rock\" episode, and it was mind-blowing! The determination and skill those climbers possess are awe-inspiring. Have you seen the one where they climb this sheer, seemingly unending cliff face? It's crazy! Makes me want to push my limits too.

I remember when we first started, we could barely make it up 'The Swarm' route. Now, we're tackling overhangs and Italian bouldering problems. It's amazing what a little practice and determination can do.\n\nSpeaking of which, I've been watching some Italian climbing documentaries for inspiration. Have you seen 'The Italian Rock Stars'? It's a great film about the country's climbing history and some of its most iconic routes.\n\nLet's keep pushing ourselves and explore new territories like you said. Who knows, maybe we'll discover some underrated Italian bouldering spots on our next adventure.\" ##", "\"I'm glad we're both making progress in our climbing, Mary.

I'm definitely adding some of those to our list of spots to explore.\n\nAlso, I've been working on coming up with some racing-themed trivia questions for our movie marathon. Here are a few that I came up with:\n\n1. What Italian car manufacturer has won the most Formula One constructor's titles?\n2. Which Italian racing driver holds the record for the most Formula One World Drivers' Championship titles?\n3. What is the name of the iconic racing track located in northern Italy, known for hosting the Italian Grand Prix?\n\nCan't wait to see how many of these we can get right during our movie marathon!\n##", "\"I couldn't agree more, Mary!

Just another fun fact to add to our Italian adventure!\" ##", "I couldn't agree more, Mary! There's so much more to Italian racing and car culture than just the races themselves. I've been doing some research and found out that Enzo Ferrari, the founder of Ferrari, got his start in racing as a driver for Alfa Romeo. He was so dedicated to racing that he would sometimes even sleep in the garage next to his cars!\n\nBy the way, speaking of Korean movies, have you seen any good ones lately related to cars or racing? I recently watched \"The Wailing\" and it was pretty intense, but not exactly what I had in mind. Anyway, let's keep the racing theme going on our hikes! I'll bring some Italian racing songs and we can keep quizzing each other with trivia questions. Can't wait! \ud83d\ude0a ##", "I was just listening to some more Italian racing songs and found another great one: \"La Grita del Cobra.\" I think it'll be perfect for our hikes!\n\nSpeaking of racing, did you know that the famous Monza racetrack in Italy is the third-oldest racetrack in the world and has hosted an impressive number of Formula One races? It's such an iconic track with so much history.\n\nI'm really looking forward to our \"compliment battles\" idea too, Mary. I think it'll add even more positivity and fun to our hikes. I've been thinking of some unique compliments already!\n\nBy the way, Mary, I was wondering if you had any favorite beginner-friendly Italian dishes you'd like to cook during our Italian-themed hikes? I'd love to learn some recipes and maybe even try cooking together during our movie marathon. It could be a fun bonding activity for us, and a delicious way to experience Italian culture!\n\nTill then, I'll keep looking for more beginner-friendly Italian songs to add to our playlist and come up with more racing trivia questions. Can't wait for the movie marathon and hikes to start! \ud83d\ude0a", "Hey Mary,\n\nI just found out that the famous Italian racing driver, Mario Andretti, has won races in different series including Formula One, IndyCar, and NASCAR! A true testament to the versatility of Italian racing talents.\n\nTalking about Andretti reminded me of a fun fact about the name \"Ferrari\". Enzo Ferrari chose the prancing horse symbol to honor his late WWI pilot father, Count Enrico Ferrari, and the horse was colored in black to symbolize mourning. It's amazing how racing and Italian heritage are deeply intertwined.\n\nBy the way, I've also prepared some themed trivia questions that I believe will keep the racing spirit alive during our hikes. I hope you're as excited as I am about the Italian-themed hiking trip and movie marathon!\n\n###", "Oh, I just remembered another interesting fact about Italian racing. Did you know that the \"Mille Miglia\" or \"Thousand Miles\" race in Italy is considered one of the most famous and historic races in the world? It's been running since 1927, and it's a grueling and challenging race that tests both the drivers and their machines.\n\nI also thought of another fun trivia question we could use: \"What famous car from Italian racing lore was featured in the movie 'The Italian Job'?\" It's a classic movie from the '60s, so I'm sure Mary has seen it.\n\nSpeaking of which, have you seen any good movies or movies related to Italian racing or cars? I've been trying to think of some, but I haven't had much luck. I'd love to hear any recommendations you might have.\n\n##", "That sounds like a great movie, Mary! I'll add \"The Great Beauty\" to my must-watch list. And speaking of Italian films, have you seen \"The Legend of 1900\"?

I hope you're practicing your kindest and most creative compliments. \ud83d\ude03\n\nAs for more Italian-themed entertainment, have you ever played the game \"Mafia\"?
