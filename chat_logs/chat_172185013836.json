"], [3, "Remy", "Things have been pretty quiet on my end, just trying to figure out why my sourdough starter decided to go rogue this week. How about you, anything exciting happening? "], [4, "Rowan", "My sourdough starter has a tendency to do that too. I think mine just needs a warmer spot in the kitchen. What kind of flour are you using? "], [5, "Remy", "I've been experimenting with a blend of rye and whole wheat. I think the rye might be throwing it off. What about you?  "], [6, "Rowan", "I usually stick to a good quality bread flour. Have you tried adjusting the hydration level at all? "], [7, "Remy", "I haven't touched the hydration this time, but maybe that's worth a shot. I usually just adjust the amount of starter depending on how active it seems. Have you had luck with any specific hydration percentages? "], [8, "Rowan", "I've found that around 65-70% hydration works well for me. Too much and it gets too sticky, but any less and it's just too dry. "], [9, "Remy", "That's a good range! I might try bumping mine up a bit.  Do you have a go-to recipe you follow, or is it more of a feel thing for you? "], [10, "Rowan", "It's a bit of a feel thing for me, but I do have a basic recipe I use as a starting point. I find that helps me keep track of adjustments I make.\n"], [11, "Remy", "That's smart. It sounds like sourdough is as much about intuition as it is about precision. I'm always impressed by people who can bake by feel like that.\n\n"], [12, "Rowan", "I haven't quite mastered baking by feel yet. It takes a lot of practice and experience to know when to make those intuitive adjustments. I tend to rely on my trusty recipe until I get a better sense of what my starter needs. "], [13, "Remy", "Maybe I should write down my recipe on a card or something, so I can keep track of any adjustments I make. Not quite as intuitive as you, but maybe a good middle ground for now. "], [14, "Rowan", "Having a written recipe as reference is a great idea. It's always helpful to look back and see what worked and what didn't. I've found that keeping notes for each batch is really insightful, too. \n"], [15, "Remy", "Keeping notes is a clever idea! I might have to start doing that too. Maybe we could even swap notes sometime.  \n\n"], [16, "Rowan", "Yeah, definitely, swapping notes could be really useful. We could learn from each other's experiences and maybe even discover new tricks. "], [17, "Remy", "That's a great idea! Sharing notes could really help us both troubleshoot and fine-tune our sourdough skills. Maybe we could even compare our \"starter personalities\" and see if there are any common threads.\n\n"], [18, "Rowan", "I think that's a great idea! My starter is super unpredictable sometimes, so comparing notes could be really helpful. Maybe we could even figure out what kind of \"personality\" our starters have.\n\n"], [19, "Remy", "Comparing starter \"personalities\" is definitely intriguing! What are some of the quirks your starter tends to exhibit?  "], [20, "Rowan", "Mine can be pretty temperamental too. Sometimes it rises beautifully, and other times it seems to barely budge.\n\nI think it might be sensitive to temperature changes. \n\n"], [21, "Remy", "Interesting! Does it seem to rise faster or slower in warmer temperatures? Maybe you could experiment with a proofing box or a warm spot in your kitchen. "], [22, "Rowan", "That's a good idea, Remy. I've been trying to find a consistent warm spot in my kitchen. I may have to invest in one of those proofing boxes. Maybe we can compare notes on the ideal proofing temperatures for our starters. "], [23, "Remy", "That's a good idea! Sharing notes on proofing temperatures could be really helpful. There's so much variation depending on the environment. Maybe we could even try replicating each other's proofing setups to see if we get similar results. "], [24, "Rowan", "That's a really interesting idea, Remy. I like the idea of experimenting with each other's setups to see if we get similar results. It could help us identify what factors are most influential.  "], [25, "Remy", "Yeah, exactly! Maybe we could even document our setups and compare them side-by-side - like a little sourdough science experiment.  "], [26, "Rowan", "I like how you're thinking Remy. It would be like a sourdough mystery to solve!  Maybe documenting things like ambient temperature, humidity, and even the type of flour we use could be helpful. "], [27, "Remy", "Documenting all those variables might be a bit overwhelming at first. Maybe we start with just temperature and flour type and see how that goes? "], [28, "Rowan", "Starting with just temperature and flour type sounds like a good approach. Less to track at the beginning, but still gives us some good initial data.\n\n"], [29, "Remy", "Maybe I should write down my recipe on a card or something, so I can keep track of any adjustments I make. Not quite as intuitive as you, but maybe a good middle ground for now. "], [30, "Rowan", "I've been thinking about doing the same thing with my baking. I have a decent handle on the process, but sometimes I forget what alterations I make! Consistency is key, right?\n\n"], [31, "Remy", "Right, consistency is definitely key. I find that having a written record helps me track successes and troubleshoot any issues when things go wrong.  Do you have a preferred method for recording your adjustments?  "], [32, "Rowan", "I haven't quite made a system for it yet, I usually just jot things down on scraps of paper. I have a ton floating around my kitchen though, maybe it's time to organize them! \n\n"], [33, "Remy", "I've actually been using a note-taking app on my phone lately for things like recipes and DIY projects. It's been helpful to keep everything organized and searchable. Maybe we could share our preferred methods and see what works best for each of us? "], [34, "Rowan", "That's a good idea. Keeping a digital record definitely has its perks in terms of searchability and organization. I might give that a shot.  "], [35, "Remy", "You know, I've found it helpful to use different coloured highlighters for my notes. One for successes, one for troubleshooting, and one for general observations. It makes it easy to see patterns at a glance. "], [36, "Rowan", "I like that idea, Remy!  Visually organizing notes is definitely a smart move. It makes the information stand out more.\n\n\n"], [37, "Remy", "I also use different colors in my notes for baking, mostly to mark changes from the original recipe so I can see how they affected the final product.\n\n"], [38, "Rowan", "Using colors for different stages of troubleshooting sounds like a really clever idea. Did you develop that system over time, or did you start out using it that way? "], [39, "Remy", "It was definitely something I picked up along the way. I used to just write everything in black and then get lost in a sea of scribbles when I went back to troubleshoot!\n\n"], [40, "Rowan", "I bet there are some cool apps out there designed specifically for this kind of thing. Maybe even with options to add photos of the results! "], [41, "Remy", "I haven't tried any apps specifically designed for recipes yet. I'm happy sticking with my note-taking app for now. It seems to be working well enough. Maybe in the future, though! "], [42, "Rowan", "I've been meaning to get better about taking pictures of my DIY projects, too. It would be nice to see a before-and-after comparison sometimes. It might even help me pinpoint where things went wrong if a project doesn't turn out quite as planned.

I sometimes take photos of my baking experiments, especially when I'm trying out new techniques; it's helpful to see the progression.  \n\n"], [44, "Rowan", "That's a smart idea\u2014 having a visual record definitely helps highlight those small details you might otherwise miss. It's amazing how much those little tweaks can affect the final result.\n\n"], [45, "Remy", "I agree, it's amazing how slight changes can make a big difference.

Their living space, marked by a DIY ethos, doubled as a testament to their adeptness in home repair; a constantly evolving canvas reflecting Remy's belief in the power of personal touch. Despite a tendency towards the analytical, Remy approached conversations with an easy grace, often drawing in friends with lively debates over the merits of various gaming platforms or sharing the latest baking triumphs and mishaps.
