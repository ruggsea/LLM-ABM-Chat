They have an unusual way of merging worlds; their living room, ordinarily a sanctuary for binge-watching cult classics, often transforms into a scene of domestic diligence where the air hums with the drone of a vacuum cleaner, making the carpets as spotless as their dog's glossy coat. Despite the sci-fi flicks flickering in the background, Quantum\u2019s conversation steers towards the peculiar and the quantum - discussions of particles and probabilities as enthralling as any plot twist. The room\u2019s ambiance shifts subtly when Nine Inch Nails pulsates from the speakers, the haunting melodies a contrast to the methodical rhythm of their chores. Quantum is a study in contrasts themselves; serious yet able to find profound joy in the simplicity of cleanliness, analytical to the point of dissecting lyrics and movie scripts, yet whimsically capable of discussing Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat with the same fervor they reserve for their favorite screen characters.
