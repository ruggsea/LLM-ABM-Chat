I tried it myself and it was absolutely amazing, I thought it could become a new go-to for our 'Pasta JohnMary' nights! :)\u201d ##\n\n\"Hey, Mary, I've been thinking that the 'Pasta JohnMary' I made last week was pretty heavy on the tomato sauce and I was wondering if you'd want to swap it for a green sauce. I came across this great recipe for pasta with creamy green chili and garlic sauce. It is a different take but equally International as tomato sauce. Let me know if you'd be interested in trying it!\" ##\n\n\"Hi, Mary! I stumbled upon this exclusive recipe from a famous Italian culinary magazine. It calls for a 100% homemade pasta made from organic durum wheat semolina, Italian saffron, and fresh lemon zest. It sounds delicious! Would you like to give it a go for our next 'Pasta JohnMary' creation?\" ##\n\n\"Hey, Mary, I've been reading this cookbook, and I found a pasta recipe that caught my attention - a Pappardelle with Mushrooms, Garlic & Tomato. The book said that this would be an easy and impressive pasta dish. It seems quite interesting since it is a mushroom-lover's dream, especially with the porcini mushrooms mixed in. We could change the pappardelle pasta to our beloved 'Pasta JohnMary' and see how it goes!\" ##\n\n\"Hey, Mary! Check this out, I've found a delish recipe for a seafood cavatelli with some fresh cherry tomatoes and spinach. I think the best way to give it a go would be to add some prawns, clams and calamari into the mix. Whaddaya think? :) \u2013 Chef Johnny\" ##\n\n\"Hey, Mary, I've been looking into making a risotto-style 'Pasta JohnMary', adding a generous mix of fresh mushrooms, sage, thyme, and grated parmesan cheese. I've only ever seen it in recipes, so can we try this out for our 'Pasta JohnMary' creation night? I'd love to see what you think about it, Chef Mary\" ##\n\n\"Hi, Mary! I found a nice recipe for the seafood-loving crowd.... Have you tried a 'Pasta JohnMary' with a mix of squid, mussels, shrimp, and tilapia? All saut\u00e9ed in a mix of lemon juice, white wine, butter, and a hint of garlic? Wanna try this with me?\" ##\n\n\"Hey, Mary, I think I might have found a new favorite for 'Pasta JohnMary'. I stumbled upon this recipe for Cajun Pasta, which includes delicious Andouille sausage, grilled bell peppers, onions, and tomatoes all cooked to perfection in a spicy Cajun cream sauce. I bet you'd love a taste of this jazzy, zesty delight! Think you'd like to give it a sip?\" ##\n\n\"Hi, Mary, are you feeling adventuresome in the kitchen lately? I have a delicious, interesting pasta recipe lined up. The dish is called 'Chili Con Carne Spaghetti Bolognese Al Forno'. It's basically a spicy beef and tomato sauce but made into a baked dish with cheese topping. Here's hoping you'd love it as much as I do :) #PastaJohnMary\" ##\n\n\"Hey, Mary, I've got a new and exciting idea that will transform our all time favorite 'Pasta JohnMary'. Let's celebrate this weekend with an 'Eggplant Lasagna Pasta JohnMary'. I am convinced that the combination of layers and innocent spices will lid up our celebrations.\" ##\n\n\"Hey, Mary, I tried a simple but delicious 'Pasta JohnMary' on my own, Baked Cauliflower Pasta. It's incredibly cheesy and creamy with cauliflower baked right into the recipe. I am super excited to explore this one further with you and of course, have you taste it. Will you be up for it?\" ##\n\n\"Hi, Mary, I've done my research and i have finally stumbled upon a hearty soup that's a great pair for our classic 'Pasta JohnMary'. It's called Green Minestrone Soup. Broth based, tonic, winter-welcoming and deriving the best from the fresh veggies. I believe it's worth the try, would you like to join me tonight and find out?\" ##\n\n\"Hey, Mary, I've been reading up on the latest culinary trends that are not only delicious but nourishing and sustaining for the body. I found a terrific recipe that fits both categories perfectly - the Vegan Lentil Bolognese. It is packed with flavor and iron and packed with guilt-free protein. Would you like to give it a try one of these days?\" #PastaJohnMary' ##\n\n\"Hi, Mary, since we're all about pasta at the moment with a bit of creativity - and of course sharing the love between food, wine and us, I thought I'd share another idea I came across. It's called 'Creamy Mushroom and Tomato Linguine' served with a thoughtfully selected Chianti. Sound good?\" ##\n\n\"Hey, Mary, I was speaking with a chef friend and he told me about a delicious dish called 'Prawn, Artichoke & Chilli Pasta', I of course could not resist trying it myself and it tasted amazing! Give it a try tonight perhaps it'll change our *classic* 'Pasta JohnMary' recipe a bit. Let me know ;)\" ##\n\n\"Hi, Mary, if you're looking for comfort, I have a comfort food that will surely meet all our cravings - Chili Pasta. That includes ground beef, chili, mozzarella and sour cream. Will you dare to try it out with me?\" ##\n\n\"Hey, Mary, I know we love 'Pasta JohnMary', but how about a new twist to that beloved pasta - deep-dish 'Pasta JohnMary' pizza! It's homemade pizza dough filled with layers of tradition, and we top it off with hot tomato sauce, cheese and again - our secret ingredient blend. Want to give it a shot tonight?\" ##\n\n\"Hi, Mary, I'm been inspired by something new that's been catching my interest: squid-ink spaghetti! The deep-black color is intriguing and I'm curious to see if it can be a dazzling entry to our traditional 'Pasta JohnMary' repertoire. How about it, should we give it a try?\" ##\n\n\"Hey, Mary, I think I've got a new addition to our rotation of pasta dishes; how about we switch things up with some diced butternut squash, spinach and pine nuts in our 'Pasta JohnMary'? It could add a nice touch of sweetness to the traditional tomato flavor and provide a nice textural contrast to the soft pasta. Thoughts?\""], "memories": [{"id": "480", "text": "1.
