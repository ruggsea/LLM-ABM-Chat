I've always found the stories of roses to be as captivating as those found in history books. The War of Roses, for instance, was a series of civil wars in England fought between two branches of the royal House of Plantagenet, the House of Lancaster and the House of York. The symbolism of the red and white roses resonates with me as I crochet, the threads entwining much like the alliances and conflicts that shaped the landscape of 15th-century England. \n\nI recently finished reading \"The Sunne in Splendour\" by Sharon Penman, which delves into the story of the Yorks and their quest for power.
