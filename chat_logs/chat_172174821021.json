I've had trouble getting the seasoning just right in the past.\""], [35, "Sage", "\"It can, so I usually start with a small amount and taste as I go. How much do you typically add?"], [36, "Maricela", "\"I usually add about a tablespoon of each, but maybe I should start with less next time.

Do you have a favorite sauce for tofu stir-fries?\""], [43, "Sage", "\"I tend to go for a simple sauce of soy sauce, rice vinegar, and a touch of sesame oil. Sometimes I'll add a little chili garlic sauce for spice too. What about you, any favorites?\""], [44, "Maricela", "\"That sounds delicious! I like to use oyster sauce and ginger in mine. It adds a bit of savory umami flavor. What is your go-to ratio for those ingredients?\""], [45, "Sage", "\"Hmm, I usually start with a 2:1:1 ratio of soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil. You can adjust it to your taste though. I find that works well for me! What about your oyster sauce and ginger combo?\"."], [46, "Maricela", "\"Thanks for sharing!
