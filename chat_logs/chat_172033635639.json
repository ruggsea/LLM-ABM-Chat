I'm delighted to hear about your curiosity regarding Caribbean traditions beyond food. While I can't claim to be an expert on cultural pastimes, I have heard about a few games and activities. In some Caribbean islands, a game called \"Dominoes\" is quite popular, especially in social settings. It's a strategic game typically played with a set of double-six dominoes.\n\nSpeaking of music, I've been enjoying a playlist featuring various Caribbean artists, and I believe you might appreciate the sounds of Soca, Reggae, and Calypso. These genres convey the lively spirit of the islands and are often accompanied by vibrant dancing. I think they would make for a great souvenir to bring back home!\n\nIn terms of cooking, don't forget to experiment with plantains, a staple ingredient in Caribbean cuisine. They can be prepared in many ways, from ripe and sweet to green and starchy, and make a delicious addition to numerous dishes.\n\nCan't wait to hear more about your experiences as you continue your exploration of the Caribbean!

When recreating Jerk seasoning at home, consider using allspice berries, which are native to the Caribbean and provide a distinctive warm, sweet, and slightly peppery flavor. For Cochinita Pibil, try incorporating sour oranges, known as Seville oranges, for a more authentic taste. They lend a unique citrusy tang that's hard to replicate with regular oranges.\n\nSpeaking of unique flavors, I recently learned about a fascinating Caribbean condiment called \"Scotch Bonnet Pepper Sauce.\" It's made from the namesake pepper, which has a fruity, slightly sweet flavor with a potent heat kick. You can use it to spice up various dishes and bring a touch of the Caribbean to your cooking. I can't wait to hear about your culinary adventures!
