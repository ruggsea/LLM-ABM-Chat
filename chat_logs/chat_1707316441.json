I've been loving Fishbach and Serge Gainsbourg, their sounds are so unique and different from what I usually listen to. I think Christine and the Queens is a great addition to our playlist as well, electro-pop is always a good energizer!\n\nI'm also still curious about exploring the Tuscan countryside for bouldering, have you had a chance to try any routes there yet? I'm sure the Strada del Vino trail in Tuscany will be amazing, I can't wait to indulge in some wine tastings and Italian cuisine.\n\nRegarding our cultural exchange playlist, I've been loving the classic French pop you've added to the mix. I wanted to share some more French music recommendations with you, have you heard of the French pop singer Camille? She has a really unique sound, and I think you'd enjoy her music. If you're interested in more classic French hits, I'd recommend checking out \"La Vie En Rose\" by \u00c9dith Piaf and \"L'\u00e9t\u00e9 indien\" by Joe Dassin.\n\nTalk to you soon,\nMary\n\n(422 characters)##"], "memories": [{"id": "53", "text": "1.
