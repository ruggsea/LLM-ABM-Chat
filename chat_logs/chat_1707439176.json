Wildlife photography is a specialized field that requires a lot of expertise and knowledge, just like hiking. I'm glad to see that wildlife photographers are recognized for their valuable skills.  By the way, have any of our friends expressed interest in seeing specific wildlife during our hikes? I think it would be fun to incorporate their requests into our trivia questions. It's always more engaging when we can relate the content to our own experiences! \n74. John: Those are some great wildlife trivia questions you came up with, Mary! I bet everyone will enjoy learning about Italy's wildlife sanctuaries and musical instruments. I did some research on the ARP for a wildlife photography instructor in the Italian Alps, and it turns out it's significantly higher than a hiking guide's ARP in the same area. It's great to see that wildlife photographers are recognized for their specialized skills.  Also, I was thinking about your question about incorporating specific wildlife requests into our trivia questions. I remember that Jane mentioned how she's always wanted to see a golden eagle in person. Maybe we could include a trivia question about the golden eagle's habitat and diet to make the hike even more engaging for her.  Regarding Italian opera-themed trivia questions, have you thought about including one about the origins of Italian opera? I remember from my previous research that Italian opera has roots that trace back to the 17th century. It might be interesting to quiz everyone on how Italian opera has evolved over time.  Can't wait to see everyone's reactions to these trivia questions during our hikes. It'll add a fun and engaging twist to our adventure. \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\udfd4 \n75. Mary: Hey John, I did some more research and found out that the ARP for a bouldering guide in the Italian Alps is actually higher than a hiking guide's in the same area. It's amazing to see how much people value specialized skills these days! I also have a few more wildlife-themed trivia questions to add to our hikes:  * What is the largest bird of prey in Italy, known for its exceptional strength and speed? * What is the name of the Italian river that is home to a wide variety of aquatic wildlife and is also a popular spot for river rafting? * Which type of animal is protected in Italy's wildlife oases and is known for its ability to adapt to different habitats?  Regarding your question about the Italian opera singer, Luciano Pavarotti, I think a new trivia question could be: What is the name of the famous Italian opera aria, often sung by Pavarotti, that features the line \"Vesti la giubba,\" which translates to \"put on the costume\" in English? I'm sure everyone will find these trivia questions interesting and engaging during our hikes. Can't wait to hear everyone's reactions! \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\udfd4 \n###\nHow do you answer? Give your answer as you would text it, in the format \"message\".
