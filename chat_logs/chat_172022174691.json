I'm curious to learn more."], [4, "Terranova", "The study I was reading showcased a diverse range of demographics, including age groups, genders, and geographical locations. One striking observation was the widespread consensus on the reality of climate change, with minimal variation across different demographic groups. However, the level of concern and the perceived urgency of the issue varied among generations, with younger individuals tending to be more worried about the consequences. Isolde, does this finding resonate with your understanding of climate change awareness?"], [5, "Isolde", "It's intriguing how different generations perceive the urgency of climate change.
