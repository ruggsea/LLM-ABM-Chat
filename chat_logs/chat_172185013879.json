It provides a satisfying weight and allows for pens to glide smoothly. What about you? Do you have a preference for lined or unlined pages? \n\n\n"], [35, "Candace", "I go back and forth between the two. Lined pages sometimes help me keep things organized, but unlined gives me more freedom to let my thoughts flow however they want.\n\n"], [36, "Rhylan", "I find having that choice built in is really helpful.
