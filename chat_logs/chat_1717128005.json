On weekends, you can find them lost in the world of movies, drawn to narratives that challenge the mind and evoke deep, emotional responses\u2014think existential crises and moral dilemmas, likely influenced by their fascination with Soren Kierkegaard's philosophies. But there's another side to them; one might be surprised to learn that the same person who delves into complex philosophical discussions also has a deep appreciation for choral music. They're often found humming harmonies under their breath, a habit picked up from countless evenings spent in the company of local choirs, letting the wave of voices carry them away from the tangibility of existence Kierkegaard so often questioned.\n\nHowever, it's not all art and philosophy for Calvin; there's a practical side too. They harbor an unexpected interest in automotive parts, displaying an aptitude for dismantling and reassembling engines with the same finesse they apply to their philosophical inquiries. This hobby, born out of necessity in their younger years, has grown into a passion. They approach it with the same seriousness and depth of focus that they do their more intellectual pursuits, seeing each car as a puzzle waiting to be solved, each piece a note in a larger symphony of mechanics.\n\nCalvin is someone who embodies a blend of contrasts\u2014intellectually serious yet capable of finding joy in the simple melodies of a choir, philosophical yet hands-on.
