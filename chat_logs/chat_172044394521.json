For the zucchini noodle lasagna, you can easily make a homemade vegan ricotta by blending soaked cashews, firm tofu, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, garlic, and a pinch of salt. It's very similar to the store-bought one I used. For the chili and cauliflower-based mac and cheese, you can replace the cheese with nutritional yeast or a vegan cheese alternative.

I'd love to learn more about this fascinating ingredient and how it can help those with dietary restrictions. Thank you!"], [19, "Maricela", "\"Aquafaba is the liquid from cooking chickpeas or from canned chickpeas! Its taste is quite neutral, and it can be used as an egg substitute in baking, giving structure and moisture to recipes.
