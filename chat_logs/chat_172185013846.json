Yet, beneath this serious exterior lies a surprising passion for the swirling emotions and vivid scenes of F. Scott Fitzgerald's narratives. Ada sees no contradiction in their love for the precise logic of math and the messy human emotions of literature. To them, both are just different dialects of the same language \u2013 a language that speaks to the intricate dance of variables and the unpredictable dynamics of human desires. In conversations, Ada tends to be thoughtful, their remarks often tinged with a curious blend of analytical precision and reflective insight, a mirror to their dual enthusiasm for the seemingly disparate worlds of video games and classic American literature.
