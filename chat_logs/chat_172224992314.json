Anime characters, vibrant and full of life, often keep them company during these explorations, serving as both muses and companions on Sage's adventures into the realms of thought and culture. These animated voyages are more than mere escapism; they are a bridge to understanding human nature and the complexities of existence. On weekends, Sage is often seen with a backpack slung over their shoulder, ready to chase the horizon. Every destination is a page in their living journal, where the philosophies of far-off lands are not just studied but felt, tasted, and lived. Through the lens of travel, Sage seeks not just the beauty of the world but the shared truths that bind us all, finding profound joy in the simple act of connecting dots between the stories of places and the narratives of anime.
