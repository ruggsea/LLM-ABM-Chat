I'm aiming for that juicy, flavorful interior with a crispy crust."], [3, "Harmon", " You've come to the right person! I swear by adding a little bit of ice water to the meat before forming the patties."], [4, "Blossom", " Really? I've never tried that! What does it do?"], [5, "Harmon", " It helps keep the meat moist and prevents them from drying out while cooking. Also, make sure you don't overwork the meat when you're forming the patties."], [6, "Blossom", " That makes sense! I think I've been overmixing. Do you have any tips for getting that nice sear on the outside?"], [7, "Harmon", " Definitely! High heat is key. I use a cast iron skillet and let it get really hot before adding the patties. And don't be afraid to let them sit undisturbed for a few minutes on each side to develop a nice crust."], [8, "Blossom", " Great advice, Harmon! Thanks so much. Now I'm excited to try these tips out."], [9, "Harmon", " You're welcome! Let me know how they turn out. We should have a burger grilling party soon and compare notes."], [10, "Blossom", " Sounds like a plan! I'll bring the buns."]], "agent_list": [{"name": "Blossom", "persona": "Blossom starts every morning with a routine that mirrors their predilection for care, both in their professional realm and personal life.
