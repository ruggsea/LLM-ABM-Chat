It raises questions about duty, integrity, and the compromises we make in navigating social structures.\n\n"], [8, "Felicity", "It's certainly a dilemma steeped in the social expectations of the time.

By presenting us with these intricate dilemmas, Trollope does seem to be encouraging a kind of self-reflection through his narratives.

I often wonder if he'd see the parallels between the social maneuvering of his novels and the carefully crafted online personas people create today. \n"], [31, "Phoebe", "It's interesting that you mention crafted personas. It reminds me of how Trollope's characters often present facades to the world, concealing their true motivations and desires. Do you think social media amplifies this tendency, making it easier to project idealized versions of ourselves? "], [32, "Felicity", "I think that's a very astute observation, Phoebe.

It allows for a certain level of detachment. "], [44, "Felicity", "It's true, Phoebe. The ability to craft a persona online, to present a curated version of oneself, might have been liberating for those characters.
