I'd love to learn more about your experiences with freshly milled flour. How does it affect the baking process, and do you have any tips for someone looking to give it a try?"], [6, "Eleanor", "I'm glad you asked, Brielle! Freshly milled flour definitely adds a unique twist to the baking process. First, it has a shorter shelf life due to the higher oil content, so I usually grind only what I need for a few days. The freshness enhances the flavor and aroma of the bread, giving it a more pronounced \"wheaty\" taste. As for tips, I recommend investing in a quality grain mill and starting with a hard wheat berry variety. Experiment with different hydration levels, as fresh flour may absorb water differently than store-bought flour. Additionally, keep in mind that dough made with freshly milled flour might require a slightly longer resting period, as it tends to be more active. I've found this process to be both challenging and rewarding, and I'm sure you'll enjoy the results!"], [7, "Brielle", "It's fascinating how freshly milled flour can make such a difference in the bread's taste and nutritional value. I'm curious if you've tried any unique grain variations, like spelt or rye, and how those have influenced the bread's flavor?"], [8, "Eleanor", "I have indeed explored various grain options, Brielle! Spelt is one of my go-to alternatives to traditional wheat. Its mild, slightly sweet flavor makes it a delightful choice for artisan bread. The gluten structure in spelt is a bit more delicate, so it may require slightly different handling techniques. I also enjoy incorporating rye into my loaves for a robust, earthy flavor and the benefits of its higher fiber content.

Have you tried baking with any ancient grains before, and if so, could you share your experiences? I'm excited to learn and explore further together."], [10, "Eleanor", "I'm fascinated by your exploration of ancient grains, Brielle! Einkorn's buttery and complex nature does sound appealing, as does emmer's earthy, nutty undertones. I haven't had the opportunity to work with those particular grains yet, but I've found that incorporating lesser-known varieties like kamut or buckwheat can also create unique and delightful breads. Kamut, for instance, has a rich, buttery, and somewhat sweet flavor, making it an excellent choice for a hearty, nutritious loaf. Buckwheat, on the other hand, is not a wheat grain but a seed, which lends a distinct, robust taste and dark color to the bread. Its gluten-free nature can be a bit challenging to work with, but the resulting loaf has a fantastic texture and flavor. I'm eager to try einkorn and emmer; perhaps we can share our experiences and recipes as we continue to explore sustainable baking practices."], [11, "Brielle", "Your experimentation with ancient grains like kamut and buckwheat sounds fascinating, Eleanor!
