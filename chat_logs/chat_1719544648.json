They approach each home repair with the strategic patience of a general, yet pour over Fitzgerald's text with the tender curiosity of a lover of words. The backyard, their personal sanctuary, is a testament to their green thumb and dedication, where the fruits of their labors grow under their careful watch\u2014a peaceful contrast to the turbulent history and rich narratives that captivate their imagination.
