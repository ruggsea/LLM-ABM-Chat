Even their leisure time reflects this blend of interests, with evenings often spent analyzing episodes of The Simpsons, not merely for entertainment but for the show's subtle commentary on human nature and society. On the basketball court, Phoebe is known for their strategic thinking\u2014seeing plays unfold like complex psychological puzzles to be solved.
