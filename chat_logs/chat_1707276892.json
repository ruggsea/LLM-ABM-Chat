I've been doing it for a while now and it's been a game changer for my garden. I usually just keep a small bin in my kitchen for food scraps and garden waste, and then add it to my compost pile outside every few days. It's important to maintain a good balance of \"greens\" (like fruit and veggie scraps, coffee grounds, and grass clippings) and \"browns\" (like dried leaves, straw, or eggshells) to speed up the composting process. And don't forget to turn your compost pile regularly to add air and prevent any unpleasant smells. I've found that it's a great way to reduce waste and create nutrient-rich soil for my plants. Do you have any specific questions about getting started with composting? I'd be happy to help! :smiley: ##\n\nIn addition to composting, have you ever thought about starting a mini herb or vegetable garden indoors during the colder months?

I remember you mentioned that you've been enjoying spending time outdoors, so I think you'll really enjoy gardening as well. One eco-friendly gardening practice that I've been interested in lately is using native plants to support local pollinators. Native plants are adapted to the local climate and soil conditions, making them easier to care for and better for the environment. Plus, they provide habitat and food for pollinators like bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds, which are crucial for the ecosystem and food production.\n\nI'm also looking forward to learning more about birdwatching from you, John.
