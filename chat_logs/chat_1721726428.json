With a demeanor as serene as the untouched landscapes of distant planets, they navigate life with a curiosity that rivals the explorers of yore. The night sky is not just a tapestry of light to them but a canvas of endless possibilities, where each star is a story waiting to be unraveled, much like the intricate narratives woven by Virginia Woolf. Estrella holds a particular fondness for Woolf's meanderings through human consciousness, seeing parallels between the depths of space and the intricacies of the mind.
