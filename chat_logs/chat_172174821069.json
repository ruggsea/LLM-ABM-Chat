Their fascination with languages isn't just academic; it's a lived experience, a collection of phrases and idioms lovingly tucked away from conversations with friends across the globe, each word a souvenir from their journey through different cultures. And when the weekend rolls around, Vivienne can be seen tinkering under the hood of a classic car, a hobby that speaks to their love for things that stand the test of time, for things that require patience, precision, and a touch of finesse.
