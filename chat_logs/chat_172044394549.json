I agree it's important to preserve the natural flow of conversations, and your suggestion balances that well. Perhaps we could set a reminder or a subtle signal for ourselves to invite less dominant speakers during our discussions."], [11, "Felicity", "I think creating a system where we take turns inviting quieter members to share their thoughts during the conversation could be helpful. For example, every time someone speaks, we could mentally note if a less dominant member has spoken recently and invite them to contribute if it's been a while."], [12, "Phoebe", "How about we use a simple hand gesture, like raising a finger when we notice it's been a while since a less dominant speaker has contributed?

One idea is to be aware of confirmation bias. It's the tendency to favor information that supports our existing beliefs, which can impact the fairness of our understanding. By acknowledging this bias and making a conscious effort to consider alternative perspectives, we can develop a more holistic view and enhance our learning experience.\""], [23, "Felicity", "That's an excellent point, Phoebe.
