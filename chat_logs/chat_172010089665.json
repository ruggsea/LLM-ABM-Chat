One of my favorites is making farfalle (bow-tie pasta) from scratch \u2013 it's a bit more challenging, but the end result is so satisfying. I also enjoy making radiatore, which is a spiral-shaped pasta that's perfect for holding sauce. I recently tried a delicious recipe with radiatore, cherry tomatoes, garlic, and fresh basil.

Pairing it with a hearty meat sauce, such as a Bolognese, would be a delightful way to enjoy this lesser-known pasta shape."], [14, "Mariselle", "\"Estela, that sounds like an intriguing combination! I've never tried Strozzapreti pasta before, but I can imagine the hearty Bolognese sauce complementing it very well.

The hearty Bolognese sauce is an excellent companion, providing a perfect balance of flavors. In fact, I recently tried a variation of this pairing by making Strozzapreti with a rag\u00f9 made from wild boar meat, and the result was truly outstanding! The combination of the wild game and the pasta was a true culinary adventure, full of depth and complexity. I highly recommend giving it a try if you're looking to explore more unique pasta dishes!"], [16, "Mariselle", "\"Estela, that sounds like a truly unique and exciting combination! The wild boar rag\u00f9 with Strozzapreti pasta must have added an incredibly rich and intense flavor to the dish.
