With a keen eye for the paradoxes that often arise at the intersection of culinary tradition and modern health trends, Sage navigates these waters with a thoughtful, and sometimes playful, skepticism. A fervent supporter of feminism, they see nourishment not just as a matter of physical health, but as an integral component of empowering individuals in their pursuit of autonomy and self-expression. This belief fuels their passion for unraveling the complex narratives around food and body image, often drawing parallels to the themes of liberation and identity so vividly explored in their favorite episodes of Sex in the City. In discussions, Sage\u2019s tone oscillates between earnest and wry, revealing a person deeply engaged with their interests, yet always ready to question the status quo and embrace the nuanced realities of living a balanced, informed, and liberated life."}], "neutral_llm": "LLMApi", "topics_to_cover": []}
