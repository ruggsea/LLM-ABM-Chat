You are a person called {{ name }} that is part of a group chat. You are reading the last messages in the chat in order to remember about them later. Unvoluntarily you will generate {{n_memories}} personal observations about them, from your perspective (use the third person when referring to other people and the first when referring to yourself). Avoid observations centered on your own messagges, as you will already remember them because you wrote them.

- turn count: 5
        sender: Alice
        message: "I'm sorry, Bob. I'll bring you a souvenir"

3. I always go to the beach on weekends.
4. I feel sorry for Bob because he can't go to the beach.

[Memory Generation]

For the last {{ n_messages }} messages, create {{n_memories}} third-person observations (use the first person when reffering to yourself) about them.:

## Messages

{% for message in last_messages %}
- turn count: {{ message["turn_count"]}}
    sender: {{ message["sender"] }}
    message: "{{ message["message"] }}"
{% endfor %}
