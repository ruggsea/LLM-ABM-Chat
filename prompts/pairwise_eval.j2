###Task Description:
An instruction (might include an Input inside it), a response to evaluate, and a score rubric representing a evaluation criteria are given.

###Instruction:
The following is a conversation between two friends.

###Response A:
{{chat_history_a}}

###Response B:
{{chat_history_b}}

###Score Rubrics:

The conversation is evaluated based on the following criteria: Naturalness, Coherence, Engagement, Consistency, Topic Precision.
Here is the score rubric:

Score 1: The conversation is completely unnatural, incoherent, and dull. Speakers' turns are inconsistent, with significant logical fallacies. The dialogue fails to address any precise topics.
Score 2: The conversation shows minor signs of naturalness but remains largely artificial. Coherence is limited, with frequent misunderstandings. Content is mostly generic with little engagement. Speakers' turns show inconsistencies and some logical fallacies. The dialogue touches on broad themes but lacks precision in addressing specific topics.
Score 3: The conversation achieves a moderate level of naturalness, coherence, and interest. Speakers' turns are somewhat consistent, with occasional logical discrepancies. The dialogue addresses some precise topics but may lack depth or specificity in certain areas.
Score 4: The conversation flows naturally and coherently, similar to non-native fluent speakers. Content is engaging and interesting. Speakers' turns are mostly consistent with few logical fallacies. The dialogue covers precise topics with good depth, though may occasionally lack full specificity.
Score 5: The conversation is as natural and coherent as two native English speakers. It's full of engaging content and very interesting. Speakers' turns are perfectly consistent without any logical fallacies. The dialogue addresses precise topics with exceptional depth and specificity throughout.
