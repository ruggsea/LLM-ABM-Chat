[[1, "Brielle", "How are you doing?"], [2, "Felicia", "I'm doing rather well, thank you. How are things with you?"], [3, "Brielle", "Things are good here. Working on a new bread recipe today. What are you up to?"], [4, "Felicia", "What kind of bread are you making?"], [5, "Brielle", "It's a sourdough rye this time. Trying to perfect the tang"], [6, "Felicia", "Do you add caraway seeds?"], [7, "Brielle", "Sometimes! Not always though. It depends on the mood. How about you, are you a caraway fan?"], [8, "Felicia", "I kind of like them in bread, but not too much. How about you?"], [9, "Brielle", "I like them, but just a touch. Too much can be overpowering."], [10, "Felicia", "I agree. They can be a bit much!"], [11, "Brielle", "Yeah, a little goes a long way. What's something you're baking these days?"], [12, "Felicia", "I've been experimenting with some lavender shortbread cookies lately."], [13, "Brielle", "Oh, those sound lovely! I've never tried baking with lavender before. What made you want to experiment with that flavor?"], [14, "Felicia", "\"I've been wanting to try something a little different than usual. Plus, lavender is very calming, so I thought it might make for a relaxing treat.\""], [15, "Brielle", "That's interesting! Do you have any other favorite herbs or spices you like to bake with?"], [16, "Felicia", "I like using rosemary in scones, it adds a nice savory note."], [17, "Brielle", "Rosemary sounds lovely in scones! I've never thought to use it. Do you have any other savory herb and spice pairings you like?"], [18, "Felicia", "\"Thyme and lemon zest are amazing in shortbread cookies! The thyme adds a subtle earthy note, and the lemon zest brightens everything up.\""], [19, "Brielle", "Wow, thyme and lemon? That's a really unique combination. I'll have to try that!"], [20, "Felicia", "\"Let me know if you want the recipe! I've been tweaking it for a while and I think it's pretty good.\""], [21, "Brielle", "\"That's so generous of you, thank you! I'd love to give it a try.\""], [22, "Felicia", "I'm happy to share! Just let me know if you need any help with substitutions or anything."], [23, "Brielle", "That's great to know, thanks! I might need some help with finding a good substitute for something, I'm not fully stocked"], [24, "Felicia", "\"What are you missing? Maybe I can suggest a swap based on what you have.\""], [25, "Brielle", "\"I'm out of lemon zest, what would you recommend as a good replacement?\""], [26, "Felicia", "\"Orange zest would be a good substitute for lemon zest! It has a similar bright citrus flavor."], [27, "Brielle", "That's a great idea! Thanks so much!"], [28, "Felicia", "\"Just be sure to use a little less orange zest, as it can be a bit stronger than lemon. \""], [29, "Brielle", "Got it, thanks! I'll keep that in mind."], [30, "Felicia", "You're welcome! Have fun baking!"], [31, "Brielle", "\"Good point, I'll definitely use less!"], [32, "Felicia", "\"Sounds like you've got it covered! Happy baking!\""], [33, "Brielle", "Thanks again! I'll let you know how it turns out!"], [34, "Felicia", "That's the spirit! Enjoy the process"], [35, "Brielle", "\"I will! Can't wait to see how it turns out!"], [36, "Felicia", "\"If you're feeling adventurous, I can share my recipe for lavender shortbread cookies. They're surprisingly delicious!"], [37, "Brielle", "\"Those sound lovely! I've never tried baking with lavender before. What made you want to experiment with that flavor?"], [38, "Felicia", "\"I've been wanting to try something a little different than usual. Plus, lavender is very calming, so I thought it might make for a relaxing treat.\""], [39, "Brielle", "That makes sense. I can see how baking with calming scents would make the experience more enjoyable"], [40, "Felicia", "\"It's really quite versatile! You can use it in cakes, cookies, even savory dishes. Have you ever tried cooking with herbs before?\""], [41, "Brielle", "That's interesting! Do you have any other favorite herbs or spices you like to bake with?"], [42, "Felicia", "\"I like using rosemary in scones, it adds a nice savory note.\""], [43, "Brielle", "Rosemary sounds lovely in scones! I'd love to try that. Do you have any tips for using it?"], [44, "Felicia", "\"Just a teaspoon or so, depending on how strong you like the flavor. You could also infuse the butter with rosemary before adding it to the dough for a more pronounced taste.\""], [45, "Brielle", "\"That's a great tip! I might have to try that this weekend.\""], [46, "Felicia", "\"I sometimes add a sprinkle of sugar on top before baking for a little extra sweetness."], [47, "Brielle", "\"Ooh, that's smart. I bet it gives a nice little crunch too."], [48, "Felicia", "\"Let me know if you want to try out a rosemary scone recipe together sometime! I have a pretty good one. \""], [49, "Brielle", "\"That sounds like fun! I'd love to try it.\""], [50, "Felicia", "\"Great! I'll send you the recipe later this week. How about we aim for Saturday afternoon?\""]]
