I just finished preparing a nutritious meal in my air fryer \u2013 brussels sprouts with a touch of lemon zest, they're quite delicious. How about you? Have you tried air frying before? It's a great way to cook healthy meals with minimal effort.\n\nBy the way, I noticed the group was discussing interviewing candidates for a job that involves working with children. I think one important question to ask would be about their creative problem-solving skills, especially when dealing with challenging situations. "], [3, "Hilary", "Hey Eliot,\nThat sounds delightful! I'm a big fan of air frying, especially for veggies. There's something magical about the crispy texture it gives them, don't you think? I often use it to make sweet potato fries or even some cauliflower wings. \n\nSpeaking of creative problem-solving, I had an interesting encounter while on my run this morning. I saw a squirrel struggling to get its nut out of a tree crevice. It kept trying to reach it from different angles but failed each time. Eventually, it took a step back, assessed the situation, and then started throwing leaves into the crevice until the nut floated up. Such a simple yet effective solution! It made me think about how we can learn so much from observing nature.\n\nBy the way, have you ever tried air frying a whole chicken? It's one of my favorite recipes. "], [4, "Eliot", "Hi Hilary,\n\nThat's a great story about the squirrel! It's fascinating how nature often provides the best lessons in problem-solving. I've never tried air frying a whole chicken, but I'm definitely intrigued now. Do you have any tips or a recipe you'd recommend?\n\nOn the topic of creative problem-solving, I think it's essential to look beyond conventional methods and consider the unique circumstances of each situation. In the context of interviewing candidates for the job with children, we could present a hypothetical scenario that requires them to think outside the box and observe how they approach the problem.\n\n"], [5, "Hilary", "Eliot,\n\nI'm glad you found the squirrel story interesting! Nature certainly has a way of teaching us valuable lessons.\n\nAs for air frying a whole chicken, it's quite simple. First, make sure the chicken is dry, then season it with your choice of herbs and spices. Preheat the air fryer to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) and cook the chicken for about 25 minutes per pound, flipping it halfway through. You can also baste it with some oil or butter for extra crispiness. Just be sure to check the internal temperature to ensure it reaches 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) for food safety.\n\nYou're absolutely right about creative problem-solving in interviews. Presenting a hypothetical scenario is an excellent idea. For instance, we could ask candidates how they would handle a disruptive child in a classroom setting while still keeping the other children engaged and learning. This would allow us to evaluate their critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as their ability to adapt to unique challenges.\n\n"], [6, "Eliot", "Hilary,\n\nThanks for the detailed air frying instructions! I'm excited to try it out. A whole chicken in the air fryer sounds delicious and convenient.\n\nRegarding the interview scenario, I completely agree that presenting a hypothetical situation is a great way to evaluate problem-solving skills. Another approach could be to ask candidates about a time when they faced a challenging situation while working with children and how they resolved it. This question would not only assess their problem-solving abilities but also give insight into their past experiences and how they handle obstacles.\n\nBy the way, have any of you considered implementing gardening or nature-based activities in the children's program? I find that connecting with the earth and observing its natural processes can foster creativity, patience, and an appreciation for the world around us.
