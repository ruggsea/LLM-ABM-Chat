How'd you like the routes?"], [3, "Florentine", " They're fantastic. Super technical and challenging."], [4, "Terra", " Awesome! Did you try that new route everyone's been talking about, \"The Vishnu?\""], [5, "Florentine", " I did! It was brutal, but I managed to send it."], [6, "Terra", " Nice! Speaking of reaching new heights, have you tried that new snail mucin serum everyone's raving about?"], [7, "Florentine", "  Snail mucin? Honestly, I'm still trying to wrap my head around that trend. I'm more of a \"less is more\" kinda gal when it comes to skincare.  What about you?"], [8, "Terra", " I know, it\u2019s definitely unconventional! But apparently it works wonders. I'm actually thinking of giving it a shot. I've been looking for something to help with these dry patches I've been getting."], [9, "Florentine", "  Maybe we should do a joint skincare experiment! We could try it out and compare notes."], [10, "Terra", " Deal! And after  we can plan a climbing trip to Rumney."]]
