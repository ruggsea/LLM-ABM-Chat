I find those earthy flavors really complement the richness of lentils. What kind of spices are you using?  "], [6, "Rhythmnetta", "I'm playing around with cumin, coriander, and a touch of smoked paprika for a little warmth. What's your go-to chili for jerk seasoning?

"], [8, "Rhythmnetta", "I'm partial to green lentils myself, they hold their shape well in stews. \nDo you have a favorite way to prepare scotch bonnets?  "], [9, "Harmony", "I prefer to roast them first to bring out their flavor. It mellows out the heat a bit too. \n"], [10, "Rhythmnetta", "Roasting them sounds like a great way to enhance their flavor. I've also been known to pickle them for a tangy twist.
