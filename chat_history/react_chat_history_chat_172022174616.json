For me, the movie's music, coupled with its visuals, crafts a truly immersive atmosphere. While discussing film soundtracks, I'd like to bring up the stunning score of 'Blade Runner 2049.'

The minimalist, discordant music adds to the unsettling nature of the movie, leaving viewers on edge. Have you seen it, Orion? Or are there other horror films that you think make great use of strings in their soundtracks?"], [15, "Orion", "I've always appreciated the way 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' uses strings to build tension, and it demonstrates how effective minimalistic music can be in setting a horror film's unsettling tone. Another horror film that comes to mind is 'Halloween' by John Carpenter. Its eerie piano melody intertwined with synth beats creates an iconic and chilling atmosphere.
