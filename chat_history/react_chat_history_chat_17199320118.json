For instance, we had a bipartisan caucus for new senators that paired us with more experienced colleagues from both parties. This arrangement allowed us to gain insights from their wisdom and knowledge, while also sharing our own fresh ideas and perspectives. Additionally, I made a conscious effort to seek advice from senators who had different backgrounds and experiences than my own.
