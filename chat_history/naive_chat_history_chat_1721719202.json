Rosemary is a bit finicky, isn't it?"], [3, "Halcyon", " It seems to be! I thought I was doing everything right, but maybe I'm overwatering it."], [4, "Elara", " Maybe. Have you checked the drainage?"], [5, "Halcyon", "  Honestly, I'm hopeless with plants. Speaking of which, have you seen that new documentary about Victorian greenhouses?"], [6, "Elara", " No, but I'm always down for a good documentary!"], [7, "Halcyon", " It's fascinating - they talk about how they used to grow all sorts of exotic plants in those giant glass houses."], [8, "Elara", " Wow, that sounds amazing. I love documentaries about history and nature. Makes me wish I had a greenhouse myself."], [9, "Halcyon", " Me too!
