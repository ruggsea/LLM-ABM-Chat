Each one a small act of resistance against the noise of everyday life. "], [17, "Cavia", "That's an interesting point about uniqueness and shared need. I wonder if the specific historical periods we find solace in might also reveal something about ourselves, like echoes of our own desires for peace in a particular era. "], [18, "Seraphina", "That's an interesting idea. I see history in a similar way - each era holds a mirror to our own experiences, even if the reflection is faded and filtered through time "], [19, "Cavia", "Perhaps those echoes are why specific anniversaries resonate so deeply with us.
