How about you, Florrie, do you have other flavor combinations you like to use in your shortbread cookies? "], [18, "Florrie", "I sometimes add a touch of lavender to my shortbread.

The salty note might highlight the herbal flavors even more. \nI might have to experiment with that myself.  "], [41, "Fabria", "I agree - fleur de sel could be a really nice touch.

Did your grandmother have a particular region of Italy in mind?  "], [48, "Florrie", "That's a good question.
