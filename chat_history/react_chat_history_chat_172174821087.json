I've been meaning to try making pesto from scratch."], [6, "Petunia", "I could share my recipe! It's pretty simple."], [7, "Rhyannon", "That would be amazing! I'd love to see it."], [8, "Petunia", "I can send it to you whenever you're ready."], [9, "Rhyannon", "When would be a good time to get it?"], [10, "Petunia", "\"Whenever works best for you!"], [11, "Rhyannon", "Let's do it later tonight then! Maybe around 8pm?"], [12, "Petunia", "\"Sounds good to me! I'll send it over then."], [13, "Rhyannon", "Sounds good. See you then."], [14, "Petunia", "Sounds good!

It's nice to connect outside of work sometimes."], [32, "Petunia", "\"Yes, it's good for the soul\""], [33, "Rhyannon", "\"Couldn't agree more!

What are your thoughts on Victorian fashion?\""], [48, "Petunia", "\" I find it fascinating. So intricate and dramatic. But honestly, I don\u2019t think I could pull off those corseted silhouettes!  \""], [49, "Rhyannon", "\"I can see why you'd say that! corsetry isn't exactly known for its comfort. What elements of Victorian fashion do you find most intriguing?\""], [50, "Petunia", "\"I'm drawn to the opulence and attention to detail, especially the use of lace, embroidery, and intricate trims.
