I'd be happy to share more tips if you're interested!"], [5, "Brielle", "I couldn't agree more, Eleanor! A healthy starter is indeed the foundation of great sourdough. I've heard that some bakers even name their starters, giving them a sense of life and nurturing them as if they were a pet. The patience aspect is so important too, as you mentioned. Taking the time to allow the dough to ferment truly enhances the flavor profile and texture. I remember reading that a longer fermentation process can also make the bread easier to digest. Some bakers even say that it's a form of meditation, being fully present in the baking process. Do you find that to be true in your experience?"], [6, "Eleanor", "I appreciate your perspective on naming starters and finding meditation in baking, Brielle.
