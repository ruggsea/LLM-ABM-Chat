What did they eat?"], [3, "Caelian", " That's a really interesting question! It varied a lot depending on their location and resources, but generally, they ate things like salted meat, hardtack biscuits, and whatever fruits and vegetables they could forage."], [4, "Cedric", " I imagine fresh food was hard to come by?"], [5, "Caelian", " Definitely. They often relied on preserved foods that could last for long periods. Hardtack, for example, was a hard biscuit made from flour and water that was incredibly durable."], [6, "Cedric", " That doesn't sound very appetizing."], [7, "Caelian", " It wasn't! But it provided the calories they needed. They would also supplement their diets with things like beans, corn, and berries when available."], [8, "Cedric", " It must have been tough to stay nourished during long campaigns."], [9, "Caelian", " Absolutely. Scurvy, a disease caused by vitamin C deficiency, was a serious problem for soldiers who didn't have access to fresh produce."]]
