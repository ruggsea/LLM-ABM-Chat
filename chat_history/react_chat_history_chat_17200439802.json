I'm still in the planning phase, but I'm heavily considering a multi-course menu inspired by various celestial bodies and space exploration milestones. For example, I'm thinking of a 'Galactic Grilled Cheese' to represent the Moon's cheese-like surface, and a 'Stardust Salad' to embody the cosmic beauty of nebulae. The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance would be a 'Solar System Sundae' with each scoop representing a different planet!

I'm picturing a vibrant and colorful dessert with each scoop representing a different planet in our solar system.

The 'Venusian Vanilla Vortex' can capture the swirling clouds of Venus using a velvety vanilla base. Our Earth will be represented by an 'Earthly Eco-Swirl' featuring a refreshing mix of mint and matcha flavors. The 'Martian Mocha Marvel' will be a mocha-infused ice cream to signify the planet's reddish appearance, while the 'Jovian Jewel' can be a stunning rainbow sherbet to denote Jupiter's colorful storms. Saturn's iconic rings may be represented by a 'Saturnine Strawberry Shortcake' layer, and Uranus and Neptune will be 'Uranian Blueberry Bliss' and 'Neptunian Nightshade' scoops, respectively. I'm still pondering ideas for Pluto, but I'm leaning towards a 'Plutonian Popsicle' to keep the frozen theme. I hope these descriptions spark your curiosity and excite your taste buds!
