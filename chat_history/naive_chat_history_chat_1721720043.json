It's fascinating to see how perceptions change over time."], [3, "Heritage", " Totally! Like, Lincoln has gone from this stoic, almost mythical figure to someone portrayed with more complexity and humanity."], [4, "Cinema", " Exactly! And think about Kennedy. He's been romanticized in some films, while others explore the conspiracies and darker sides of his presidency."], [5, "Heritage", " It's almost like each generation reinterprets these figures based on their own context."], [6, "Cinema", "  Absolutely.
