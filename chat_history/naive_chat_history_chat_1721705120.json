Anything you recommend?"], [3, "Layla", " Hmm, what's your skin type? Mine's more on the dry side, so I use a lot of moisturizing products."], [4, "Cavia", " I think mine's kind of combination."], [5, "Layla", " Oh, for that you might want to look for something that balances oil production without being too drying."], [6, "Cavia", " Right, I'll keep that in mind. It\u2019s funny, my boyfriend actually bought me a bunch of skincare stuff for our anniversary."], [7, "Layla", " You're lucky! What kind of stuff did he get you?"], [8, "Cavia", " He got me this fancy cleanser, a serum, and this hydrating mask.
