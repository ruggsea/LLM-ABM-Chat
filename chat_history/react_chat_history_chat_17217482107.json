Perhaps we should dedicate some time to exploring ways to contribute to that shared purpose."], [43, "Averill", "\"Absolutely, I'm always up for brainstorming ways to make a difference."], [44, "Selene", "\"I wholeheartedly agree.  Perhaps we could brainstorm some ideas soon?\""], [45, "Averill", "\"I'd love that. When might work for you?\""], [46, "Selene", "\"How about next week?
