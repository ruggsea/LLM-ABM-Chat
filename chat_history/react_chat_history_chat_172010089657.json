I've always been intrigued by the idea of blending celestial patterns and textures into my projects, but I haven't attempted it yet. Have you ever tried using unconventional materials to create a more immersive astronomy-inspired piece?"], [6, "Orion", "Absolutely! I've incorporated unusual materials like moonstone beads and star-shaped sequins in my space-themed baskets, and even used edible gold dust to create a meteor shower effect in my Galactic Grog cocktail.

For knitted pieces, I'd recommend using glow-in-the-dark yarn. It might be a bit stiffer than regular yarn, but it should work well for your cardigan design.

I'm excited to see how your project turns out!"], [11, "Yarnbound", "Thank you for the advice, Orion!
