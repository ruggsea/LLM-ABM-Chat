The recent changes in economic policy are really affecting my family\u2019s budget."], [3, "Aria", " Oh no, I\u2019m sorry to hear that. What specifically has been impacted?"], [4, "Meli", " Well, the rising cost of living is hitting us hard. Groceries and gas are so much more expensive now."], [5, "Aria", " Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed that too. It\u2019s been difficult to keep up."], [6, "Meli", " Exactly! And the new tax laws aren\u2019t helping either. My husband and I are having to work extra hours just to make ends meet."], [7, "Aria", " It\u2019s truly affecting everyone, isn't it? My family has had to cut back on a lot of things as well."], [8, "Meli", " It\u2019s discouraging. We were really hoping to save some money for a family vacation this year, but it's looking less likely now."], [9, "Aria", " I hear you. It seems like every time we get ahead, something else comes up."], [10, "Meli", "  It's frustrating.  Do you think things will get better anytime soon?"]]
