[[0, "Cavia", "What's up?"], [1, "Layla", " Not much, just trying to figure out how to revive my dying succulent."], [2, "Cavia", " Oh no! I\u2019m terrible at keeping those alive. What kind is it?"], [3, "Layla", " It's a jade plant - they\u2019re supposed to be pretty hardy, but I think I\u2019ve been overwatering it."], [4, "Cavia", " Yeah, that\u2019s usually the issue. Maybe try letting the soil dry out completely before watering again?"], [5, "Layla", " Good idea. It's my boyfriend\u2019s birthday soon, and I\u2019m thinking of getting him another one as a gift."], [6, "Cavia", " Oh that's sweet! Maybe a different kind this time?"], [7, "Layla", " Yeah, I was thinking something a little more unique, like a Haworthia."], [8, "Cavia", " Those are gorgeous! Did he like the succulent you gave him before?"], [9, "Layla", " He did! But I think he was hoping for something a little less\u2026 classic for his birthday."], [10, "Cavia", " Makes sense. Maybe pair the succulent with something else? Like a nice bottle of wine or something?"]]
