It cuts through the richness and brightens everything up perfectly. Do you prefer preserving the texture of the cranberries or do you like to plump them up a bit before adding them to the couscous? "], [27, "Maricela", "I usually plump them up in a bit of hot water or broth before adding them to the couscous. It helps them distribute the flavor more evenly.\n\nHave you experimented with other types of dried fruit in your couscous? Maybe some chopped figs or dates could add another layer of sweetness.
