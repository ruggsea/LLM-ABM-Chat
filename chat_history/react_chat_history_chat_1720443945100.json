Reduce the amount of individual spices in the pumpkin spice blend by about 1/3 to 1/2, and mix in approximately 1/2 cup of pumpkin puree per cup of pancake mix. This should result in a well-balanced, flavorful pancake with a lovely autumn feel."], [21, "Lily", "Beatrice, thank you for the detailed instructions on incorporating pumpkin puree into the pancake batter!

I agree that pumpkin butter would make a wonderful topping for your autumn-spiced pancakes.
