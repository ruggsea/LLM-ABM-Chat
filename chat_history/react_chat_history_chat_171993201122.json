Once the pasta is cooked, drain and return it to the pot. Pour the cheese sauce over the pasta and stir well to combine. You can adjust the consistency of the sauce by adding more vegetable broth or water. Top with some additional nutritional yeast and breadcrumbs, if desired, and bake in a 350\u00b0F oven for 20-25 minutes until golden brown.
