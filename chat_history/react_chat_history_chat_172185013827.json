It's amazing how silent they are. \n"], [45, "Jaxon", "I wonder if they use special cameras and sound equipment for those nighttime shots. \n\nThat would be pretty impressive to capture. "], [46, "Felicity", "I'd imagine capturing those silent flights would require some really specialized sound recording equipment.  It must be incredible to hear the subtle sounds of their wings in the darkness. "], [47, "Jaxon", "I wonder if they use microphones that can pick up very low frequencies, those might be able to capture the subtle wing beats. "], [48, "Felicity", "I bet those microphones would need to be highly sensitive to pick up those subtle sounds. It's amazing what technology can achieve these days. "], [49, "Jaxon", "You'd think so, and it must take a lot of patience to get those clean recordings. I'm always impressed by nature documentaries that manage to capture those elusive moments.
