"], [44, "Florrie", "Fabria,\n\nI like your idea of a student creation showcase. It will not only allow them to express their creativity but also strengthen their connection with cacti and other plants. I have a few cacti-themed coloring pages and stickers that we can distribute during the showcase.\n\nTo make the Q&A session more interactive, I propose we use a tool like mentimeter or slido, where students can submit their questions anonymously, and we can address the most popular ones. This way, we can ensure that the topics of interest for the students are covered.\n\nLooking forward to our engaging and memorable workshop!\n\nBest,\nFlorrie \n\n[Attached: CactiColoringPages.pdf](CactiColoringPages.pdf) \n\n"], [45, "Fabria", "Fabria: Hello Florrie, I really like the idea of using an anonymous question submission tool for the Q&A session. It will give the students an extra level of comfort to ask their questions and ensure we cover the topics they're most interested in. \n\nI've also been thinking about incorporating a short wrap-up segment at the end, where we summarize the key takeaways from all the discussion topics and activities. This will provide students with a clear understanding of what we've covered and encourage them to apply their newfound knowledge in their daily lives. \n\nLooking forward to co-facilitating an enriching and unforgettable workshop experience together.

It will not only help them consolidate their learning but also inspire them to incorporate cacti care and sustainability into their daily lives.\n\nIn the meantime, I have prepared a set of cacti-themed origami instructions that students can use for the hands-on activities. These fun and educational origami projects will not only showcase their creativity but also reinforce their understanding of cacti species.\n\nLooking forward to our successful and impactful workshop!\n\nBest,\nFlorrie \n\n[Attached: CactiOrigamiInstructions.pdf](CactiOrigamiInstructions.pdf) \n\n"], [47, "Fabria", "Fabria: Hello Florrie, I've been thinking about potential icebreaker activities to start our workshop on a positive note and encourage students to feel more connected. How about a brief \"Cactus Trivia\" game where students can answer fun and educational questions about cacti?
