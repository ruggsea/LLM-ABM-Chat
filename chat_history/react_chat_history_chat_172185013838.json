Did you ever catch that one, Heritage? "], [4, "Heritage", "I haven't seen that one, but Roosevelt's penchant for action and adventure makes me wonder if he would approve of that kind of cat-and-mouse chase.  \n\nMaybe a film about his daring expeditions to South America, or his time as a rancher in the Dakotas, would be more his style.

"], [50, "Heritage", "You bring up a good point about how Presidential style evolving, Cinema. Maybe the change in image also reflects the changing expectations of the American public. Think about how FDR's fireside chats over the radio helped him connect with people during a time of national crisis.  It shows how a president's presentation can be as important as their policies when it comes to gaining public trust. "]]
