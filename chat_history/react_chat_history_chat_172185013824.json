What about you, anything interesting happening? "], [3, "Brielle", "I'm doing pretty well, thanks. I've been experimenting with a new herb garden. Rosemary and thyme are thriving this season. What kind of sourdough did you make? "], [4, "Eleanor", "I went for a classic sourdough this time. Nothing too fancy, but the crust is lovely and crunchy. I'm always eager to try new herbs in the summer, rosemary is fantastic paired with roasted vegetables.\n\n"], [5, "Brielle", "I've been meaning to try roasting some vegetables with rosemary. What other herbs do you like to use in your garden? "], [6, "Eleanor", "I've had good luck with basil and oregano lately. They add such a depth of flavor to simple dishes. "], [7, "Brielle", "Basil and oregano sound delightful! I've been thinking of planting some lavender too, for something a bit different.  Do you use lavender in your cooking? "], [8, "Eleanor", "Lavender can be lovely in desserts, I've found. It adds a subtle floral note. \n"], [9, "Brielle", "That's a lovely idea for desserts. I've mostly used it for sachets and homemade soaps, but I could see it working well in shortbread cookies.\n\n"], [10, "Eleanor", "Shortbread cookies with lavender sounds incredibly intriguing.  I've always preferred savory dishes, but this might tempt me to try something new. "], [11, "Brielle", "Lavender shortbread cookies pair well with a cup of chamomile tea.

Sometimes the simplest things are the most satisfying. Perhaps we could try both - a classic chamomile and one with a hint of mint or lavender? \nThat way we can compare.  \n"], [18, "Eleanor", "That sounds like a delightful plan. We could make it a poll on a classic versus a flavored option. \n\n"], [19, "Brielle", "Sounds like a plan.  Maybe we could invite a few more friends to join in on the fun?

Perhaps we could start around 2 pm and see where the afternoon takes us?  \n"], [28, "Eleanor", "That sounds like a good time. I can confirm my schedule tomorrow.  "], [29, "Brielle", "Perfect.  Does anyone else have a preference for earlier or later in the afternoon? "], [30, "Eleanor", "Later in the afternoon might be better for me, as I like to get some things done in the mornings.  \n\n"], [31, "Brielle", "It sounds like later in the afternoon is best for both of us. What time were you thinking?\n\n"], [32, "Eleanor", "Maybe around 4pm? That way, we'll have some time to settle in after lunch. \n"], [33, "Brielle", "That sounds lovely. I can do 4pm as well. Shall we say 4pm at your place, Eleanor? "], [34, "Eleanor", "Yes, my place works for me.  See you then.  "], [35, "Brielle", "Perfect. I can't wait!  I'll bring a loaf of sourdough, fresh from the oven. "], [36, "Eleanor", "That's very kind of you, Brielle. I'm looking forward to trying it. Shall I make us some tea?

"], [42, "Eleanor", "I usually take mine black or with a touch of honey.\n\n"], [43, "Brielle", "I usually stick to local honey or a touch of maple syrup. I find their flavors complement the herbal notes quite well. What about you, Eleanor, do you have any favorite local sources for honey? "], [44, "Eleanor", "I actually have a friend who keeps bees just outside the city. Their honey is incredible, with such a distinct floral bouquet.\n\n"], [45, "Brielle", "That sounds wonderful, Eleanor! I'd love to try it.  Do you know what kinds of flowers the bees favor?

Clover and wildflower honey sounds absolutely delightful. The idea of those subtle floral notes sounds perfect with a chamomile tea.

It's always a delightful surprise. \n\n"], [49, "Brielle", "That's fascinating how the terroir of the wildflowers influences the honey's flavor. It speaks to the interconnectedness of nature, don't you think?
