[[1, "Phylicia", "How is it going?"], [2, "Florentia", "Pretty good, how about yourself?"], [3, "Phylicia", "I'm doing alright, thanks for asking. How's your week going?"], [4, "Florentia", "It's been busy but good, lots of work to do with my plants! How about yours?"], [5, "Phylicia", "Mine are doing well, thanks for asking. I managed to propagate a new pothos cutting recently!"], [6, "Florentia", "That's wonderful! I'm always so impressed with people who can propagate so effortlessly. I'm still working on getting consistent success with mine."], [7, "Phylicia", "What kind of plants are you trying to propagate? Maybe I can offer some tips!"], [8, "Florentia", "That would be great! I'm mostly struggling with getting the cuttings to root."], [9, "Phylicia", "What type of cuttings are you trying to root? I find that using a rooting hormone powder and keeping the soil consistently moist works well for most species."], [10, "Florentia", "I actually haven\u2019t tried rooting hormone yet, maybe that\u2019s what I\u2019m missing! I\u2019ll try keeping the soil more consistently moist too, thanks!"], [11, "Phylicia", "That's great! I hope it helps! Let me know how it goes."], [12, "Florentia", "I will definitely keep you updated! Thanks again for the tips."], [13, "Phylicia", "You're welcome! I'm always happy to help another plant parent."], [14, "Florentia", "It's been a mixed bag so far, some have started to root but others haven't. I suspect it's mostly my technique though!"], [15, "Phylicia", "Have you thought about trying a humidity dome or a clear plastic bag over the cuttings? That can help trap moisture."], [16, "Florentia", "I haven't tried that before, what's the best way to create a humidity dome?"], [17, "Phylicia", "You can buy a humidity dome at most garden centers, or you can DIY one by covering the pot with a clear plastic bag and securing it with a rubber band."], [18, "Florentia", "\"Do you have any tips on keeping the bag from touching the leaves?\""], [19, "Phylicia", "You can try  using stakes or chopsticks to create some space between the bag and the leaves."], [20, "Florentia", "\"Good idea! Thanks so much for the tip.\""], [21, "Phylicia", "You're going to have so many leafy friends soon!"], [22, "Florentia", "That's really helpful. I think I have some chopsticks lying around."], [23, "Phylicia", "That's great! Good luck with your propagations!"], [24, "Florentia", "Thanks for the tips, I'm so excited to try them out!"], [25, "Phylicia", "Sounds like you've got this! Let me know how it goes."], [26, "Florentia", "I'll absolutely keep you posted! I'm sure they'll be thrilled with the extra humidity. Have you had much luck propagating Pothos yourself?"], [27, "Phylicia", "Mine are doing well, thanks for asking. I managed to propagate a new pothos cutting recently!"], [28, "Florentia", "That's wonderful! I'm always so impressed with people who can propagate so effortlessly. I'm still working on getting consistent success with mine."], [29, "Phylicia", "What kind of struggles have you been having with propagation? Maybe I can offer some specific tips!"], [30, "Florentia", "\"Well, sometimes my cuttings just don't seem to root. I followed all the instructions, but they become wilted and don\u2019t develop any new growth. What about you\u2013 do you use a particular rooting hormone or method?\""], [31, "Phylicia", "I find that using a rooting hormone powder and keeping the soil consistently moist works well for most species."], [32, "Florentia", "I actually haven\u2019t tried rooting hormone yet, maybe that\u2019s what I\u2019m missing! I\u2019ll try keeping the soil more consistently moist too, thanks!"], [33, "Phylicia", "That's great! I hope it helps! Let me know how it goes."], [34, "Florentia", "That\u2019s really helpful, I\u2019ll definitely give that a shot. I\u2019m excited to try it out!"], [35, "Phylicia", "Nice! It really can make a big difference. Let me know if you have any other questions."], [36, "Florentia", "\"That's so kind of you! I really appreciate it. Do you have a preferred brand of rooting hormone?\""], [37, "Phylicia", "\"I've had good luck with Hormex. It's relatively inexpensive and easy to find at most garden centers."], [38, "Florentia", "\"Do you happen to know if it comes in liquid form as well?\""], [39, "Phylicia", "\"I believe it does! I've seen both powder and liquid versions at my local garden center.\""], [40, "Florentia", "\"That's helpful to know, thanks! I'll see which form they have available at the garden center near me. \""], [41, "Phylicia", "\"Yes, they definitely make both! Good luck with your propagation adventures!"], [42, "Florentia", "That\u2019s great! I\u2019ll check what they have! Thanks again for all the tips!"], [43, "Phylicia", "If you can't find the type you want, some places will order it for you."], [44, "Florentia", "\"Awesome, thank you! I really appreciate all your help\""], [45, "Phylicia", "You're welcome! Happy to help. Happy gardening!"], [46, "Florentia", "Thank you again! I'm feeling much more confident about this propagation attempt now."], [47, "Phylicia", "You got this! Let me know how it goes!"], [48, "Florentia", "\"Thanks, Phylicia! I'm ready to give it my best shot!"], [49, "Phylicia", "That's the spirit! I'm excited for you."], [50, "Florentia", "\"I'll definitely keep you posted!\""]]
