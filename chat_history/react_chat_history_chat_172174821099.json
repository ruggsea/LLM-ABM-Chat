[[1, "Remy", "Hello!"], [2, "Lila", "Hello Remy! How are you doing?"], [3, "Remy", "I'm doing pretty well, thanks! How are you?"], [4, "Lila", "I'm good, just trying out a new sourdough starter recipe. Sort of a baking adventure! How about you, anything exciting happening?"], [5, "Remy", "Actually, I just got a new stand mixer! Been wanting to try more elaborate baking recipes.  What kind of sourdough starter are you using?"], [6, "Lila", "It's a rye starter, a little more complex to maintain but I find the flavor worth it. What about you, what kind of mixer did you get?"], [7, "Remy", "It's a KitchenAid, the Artisan series. I've heard good things! What kind of bread are you hoping to make with your starter?"], [8, "Lila", "I'm hoping to try a classic sourdough boule! Always wanted to master it. How about you, anything you're looking to tackle with your new mixer?"], [9, "Remy", "I've always wanted to make a good ciabatta! It seems daunting though."], [10, "Lila", "Ciabatta can be tricky, but it's so rewarding when you get that airy crumb! I have a recipe I could share if you're interested."], [11, "Remy", "That would be amazing, thanks! I appreciate it."], [12, "Lila", "I'd be happy to send it over. When do you want to try it?"], [13, "Remy", "This weekend maybe? I have some time to get started."], [14, "Lila", "\u201cJust keep in mind, if you\u2019re making your own starter from scratch, it takes a few days to become active before you can use it."], [15, "Remy", "Oh, good to know, thanks! I'm actually using a store-bought starter."], [16, "Lila", "\"Good choice! Those can be a great way to get started."], [17, "Remy", "Yeah, I figured starting with something ready-made would be a good first step."], [18, "Lila", "That makes sense! Those are really convenient. What brand did you go with?"], [19, "Remy", "It's a King Arthur Flour starter. Seems pretty popular."], [20, "Lila", "\"Good choice! They have a good reputation."], [21, "Remy", "Yeah, I've heard good things about them too."], [22, "Lila", "\"They make great products - good choice!"], [23, "Remy", "I'm excited to give it a try!"], [24, "Lila", "\"That's the spirit! Let me know how it goes. Maybe we can even compare notes sometime. \""], [25, "Remy", "\"That sounds fun! I'm always up for swapping tips and tricks."], [26, "Lila", "\"I've had some interesting successes\" and failures lately, so I'd be happy to share my experiences!"], [27, "Remy", "\"Oh, I'm sure I'll have plenty of those myself! Beginner's luck only goes so far, haha.\""], [28, "Lila", "\"I can give you some tips on how to avoid any beginner pitfalls! What kind of flour do you plan on using?"], [29, "Remy", "I'm thinking of starting with all-purpose, but I'm open to suggestions!"], [30, "Lila", "\"I usually use a blend of bread flour and all-purpose for a little more structure. Gives a nice crumb."], [31, "Remy", "\"That's a good idea! I didn't even think about using a blend."], [32, "Lila", "\"I usually let mine rise for about 12 hours before baking. Do you have a recipe or are you starting from scratch?"], [33, "Remy", "\"I was thinking of looking up a few recipes online to get a decent starting point! Any favorites you'd recommend?"], [34, "Lila", "\"Plenty! I\u2019ve been experimenting with some from a book called 'Flour Water Salt Yeast'. There's a really good basic sourdough recipe to get you started. Would you like me to send you a link?"], [35, "Remy", "\"Yes, please! I'd love that. Thank you!\""], [36, "Lila", "\"Sure, one sec! I\u2019ll find it for you."], [37, "Remy", "Thanks! I'm excited to take a look."], [38, "Lila", "\"No problem! It\u2019s a really good resource for beginners."], [39, "Remy", "\"Awesome, thanks so much!"], [40, "Lila", "\"You're welcome! Happy baking!"], [41, "Remy", "\"Great, I appreciate it!

I'm always curious to hear about people's baking adventures.\""], [45, "Remy", "\"I'll definitely keep you posted!\""], [46, "Lila", "Sounds good! I look forward to hearing about it!"], [47, "Remy", "\"Will do!\""], [48, "Lila", "That's great! I love hearing about people's baking journeys."], [49, "Remy", "\"I'll definitely send you a picture when it's done!"], [50, "Lila", "\"That sounds great! I can't wait to see it!\""]]
