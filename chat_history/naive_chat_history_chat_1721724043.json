I saw you posted a picture with your new tiger cub!"], [2, "Siegfried", " Yeah, he's amazing, isn't he?"], [3, "Este", " He is beautiful. But I can't help but worry about keeping such a dangerous animal as a pet."], [4, "Siegfried", " Oh come on, he's just a baby! He's harmless."], [5, "Este", " But he will grow up to be a very powerful predator. Don't you think it's irresponsible to keep him in captivity?"], [6, "Siegfried", " Look, I take all the necessary precautions. He's in a secure enclosure, and I have experienced handlers helping me."], [7, "Este", " Still, it just seems cruel to me.

It just feels ethically wrong to me."]]
