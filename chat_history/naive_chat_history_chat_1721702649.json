Have you had any luck with attracting purple martins to your yard yet?"], [3, "Seraphina", " Not yet, unfortunately. I put up a martin house last spring, but no takers."], [4, "Jocelyn", " Oh no! Maybe it's not in the right spot. They like to have a clear view of the sky."], [5, "Seraphina", " That's what I thought too! Mine is in a pretty open area."], [6, "Jocelyn", " Hmm, maybe try putting up some decoys. You know, some plastic martins to make it look like there's already a community there."], [7, "Seraphina", " That's a good idea! I heard they also like gourd houses. Maybe I should try both?"], [8, "Jocelyn", " Absolutely! And don't forget to keep the area around the house clean and free of debris."], [9, "Seraphina", " Good point! Thanks for the tips! I'm going to try all of that."]]
