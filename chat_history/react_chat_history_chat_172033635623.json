Users could earn points for various sustainable actions, and the score could be updated dynamically based on their ongoing \"Eco-Actions.\"\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these suggestions, Pierre?

I like the dynamic nature of this feature, as it would allow users to see the immediate impact of their eco-friendly actions.\n\nTo further enhance the community aspect, I suggest we create a leaderboard that showcases the top \"Eco-Impact Scores\" of the week or month. However, to maintain a supportive atmosphere, we should provide users with the option to reset their scores periodically or participate in a \"Community Mode,\" where scores are hidden, and users can focus on collaborative efforts instead of individual competition.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on incorporating a dynamic \"Eco-Impact Score\" with both competitive and collaborative leaderboard options, Jardin?
