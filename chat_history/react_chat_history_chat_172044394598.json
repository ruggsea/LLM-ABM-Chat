Happy gardening!\""], [23, "Lavender", "Speaking of strawberries, did you know that they are the only fruit that wear their seeds on the outside? Around 200 seeds are scattered on the average strawberry!"], [24, "Sage", "That's quite fascinating, Lavender! I wonder how this unique feature affects the growth and care of strawberries. Are there any specific considerations when it comes to planting and nurturing them, given their seeds' positioning?"], [25, "Lavender", "Sage, that's an excellent question! Strawberries have a fascinating way of reproducing - through their seeds on the outside. This feature, known as \"botanical dissemination,\" means that strawberries are technically not single fruits but multiple fruits with each seed being an individual fruit. When planting strawberries, it is common to use strawberry crowns (the central part of the plant where the leaves grow) instead of seeds. This allows for stronger and more consistent growth. As for nurturing, strawberries generally prefer well-drained soil and partial shade, and they benefit from regular watering and mulching. I'm excited to see your progress with your own fruit garden, and I'm here to help with any questions you might have! Happy gardening!"], [26, "Sage", "Lavender, thank you for enlightening me about the reproductive process of strawberries.

Strawberries, with their seeds on the outside, do not present any specific challenges in the growth process, but they do require well-drained soil, partial shade, and regular watering and mulching.
