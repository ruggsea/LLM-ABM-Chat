"], [3, "Aria", "It's interesting that you find baking calming. There's something quite satisfying about the process, isn't there? The methodical nature of it. My week has been going well, I've been dissecting some Bach fugues - it's amazing how the different voices intertwine. What kind of bread did you make?  \n "], [4, "Evelyn", "Rye, it's quite dense and earthy.\n\nI can see the appeal of dissecting fugues, the complexity must be fascinating. Similar to tracing the steps in a well-made loaf, I imagine. \n"], [5, "Aria", "It's amazing how those seemingly simple ingredients come together in such a complex way, isn't it?  The balance of flavors and textures. Do you have a favorite type of rye flour to use? "], [6, "Evelyn", "I prefer a dark rye, it adds a depth of flavor that I find quite appealing. Do you listen to music while you work on your fugues? I find music can sometimes be distracting but other times it helps me concentrate.

What about you?\n\n"], [11, "Aria", "That's understandable; the emotional expressiveness of the Romantics is certainly captivating.

The way he captures fleeting emotions is quite extraordinary.\n\n*What are you baking these days?* "], [15, "Aria", "I'm currently experimenting with sourdough. It's a fascinating process, trying to cultivate a healthy starter and understand the nuances of wild fermentation. It's a lot like working with living organisms \u2013 delicate and rewarding.

They often have a good selection of rye varieties. I find the quality and freshness make a noticeable difference in the final product. \n\n"], [23, "Aria", "That's a great idea! I haven't explored local millers yet, I usually buy from a well-regarded online retailer. I'm curious to know if you notice a difference in taste compared to commercially milled flour.

"], [25, "Aria", "I haven't ventured too far from sourdough yet, I'm still perfecting my technique. But I do have a fondness for a good baguette - the crusty exterior and soft interior are quite satisfying.  \n"], [26, "Evelyn", "I enjoy a good baguette as well, especially when freshly baked.

What about you, what type of flour do you usually use for your baguettes? "], [36, "Evelyn", "I usually go for a classic white bread flour for baguettes, but I sometimes experiment with adding a small percentage of rye for a bit more complexity. "], [37, "Aria", "Rye can add an interesting note, a subtle earthiness that complements the classic baguette flavor. Do you find that using rye flour changes the texture as well?"], [38, "Evelyn", "I do notice a difference in texture, it tends to be a bit denser. But I like that it adds a slight chewiness to the crumb. What kind of wheat do you use in your sourdough starter? "], [39, "Aria", "I use a combination of organic white and whole wheat.

It reminds me of those artisan baguettes with the characteristic pointy ends.\n\nDo you have a favorite type of flour to use for your baguettes?
