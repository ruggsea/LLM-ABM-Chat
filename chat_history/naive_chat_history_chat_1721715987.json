Say, how\u2019d that deep sea fishing trip go last week?"], [3, "Numeriya", " It was amazing! We caught some big ones this time."], [4, "Salta", " That\u2019s awesome! I bet you used that new jigging technique you were trying out?"], [5, "Numeriya", " Yeah, it seems to be working really well."], [6, "Salta", " You know, it\u2019s funny, with all this talk of fishing, it\u2019s making me think about getting a new stroller for the baby."], [7, "Numeriya", " Oh, right! How is little Amelia doing?"], [8, "Salta", " She\u2019s great! Growing like a weed.
