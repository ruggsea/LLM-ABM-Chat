It allows us to explore the consequences of our actions, reflect on our emotions, and practice kindness in a virtual world."], [12, "Harmonii", "\"I couldn't agree more, Ada! 'Life is Strange' does a fantastic job of presenting real-life dilemmas. I'm also fond of 'Papers, Please', which forces players to make moral choices as an immigration officer. It sheds light on the complexities of bureaucracy, politics, and humanity, promoting a better understanding of various perspectives."], [13, "Ada", "Speaking of transporting us to new worlds, have you ever tried 'The Sims' series, Harmonii?
