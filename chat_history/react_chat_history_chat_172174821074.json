How about you? What are you up to?"], [6, "Claire", "Just experimenting with some new Camembert recipes. Nothing too exciting, what about you?"], [7, "Juliette", "Oh, interesting! Do you have a favorite cheese-focused cookbook you like to use?"], [8, "Claire", "I tend to draw inspiration from a few different sources online, but haven't really found a go-to cookbook yet. You?"], [9, "Juliette", "\"Have you tried looking for any French cookbooks? I find they often have some beautiful cheese recipes.\""], [10, "Claire", "That's a good idea, maybe I'll check some out online. Do you have any recommendations?"], [11, "Juliette", "I really like \"The Book of Cheese\" by Juliet Harbutt.

I will have to seek it out!\""], [21, "Juliette", "\"Another one I really enjoy is the Spy Valley Sauvignon Blanc.

I'll have to give it a shot.\""], [29, "Juliette", "\"The Sancerre region of the Loire Valley is particularly known for Sauvignon Blanc's that pair beautifully with ch\u00e8vre.  Give it a try!"], [30, "Claire", "\"Thanks for the recommendation! I'll definitely look into Sancerre Sauvignon Blancs."], [31, "Juliette", "\"You could even try a goat cheese salad with a Sancerre. It's a classic pairing! \""], [32, "Claire", "\"I've always loved a good goat cheese salad, sounds like a perfect pairing."], [33, "Juliette", "\"My favorite recipe uses walnuts, honey, and a light vinaigrette. It's divine. Let me know if you'd like the recipe."], [34, "Claire", "\"Yes please, that sounds delicious!"], [35, "Juliette", "Sure, I can send you the recipe.  It's quite simple, really.
