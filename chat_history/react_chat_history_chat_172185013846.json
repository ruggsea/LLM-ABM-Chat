"], [5, "Ada", "It's a real-time strategy game. There's a lot of resource management and unit coordination involved, which makes planning ahead crucial.  What about you, are you more of a puzzle person or do you prefer action-packed games? "], [6, "Harmonii", "I tend towards games that let me explore and get immersed in a story. Although, a good puzzle can be quite satisfying to crack.  \n\nWhat's your favorite part about real-time strategy games?
