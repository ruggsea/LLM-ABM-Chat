The story revolves around a group of friends who discover a hidden message leading them to believe lost technology may still exist.\n\nIt's a mix of adventure, survival, and mystery.  \n\n"], [6, "Stitch", "Sounds interesting. Is it more combat-focused, or is exploration a big part of it? "], [7, "Rowan", "I'd say it leans more towards exploration and puzzle-solving.  There's definitely combat, but a lot of the gameplay seems to revolve around uncovering the mysteries of this lost technology. "], [8, "Stitch", "That sounds right up my alley then.
