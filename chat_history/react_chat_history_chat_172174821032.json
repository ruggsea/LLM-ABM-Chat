It's good to be cautious."], [12, "Journey", "Do you have jack stands under there too?"], [13, "Riley", "\"Oh yeah, I wasn't about to get under there without them.

Glad you two made it out okay."], [42, "Journey", "\"We were both pretty shaken up, but yeah, luckily made it out okay. Kinda puts things in perspective, though, you know?"], [43, "Riley", "\"Yeah, those kinds of experiences definitely make you realize what's important.\""], [44, "Journey", "\"Absolutely. Like, you realize how important it is to appreciate the moment and the people you're with. It's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day stuff. \""], [45, "Riley", "\"Totally! It's easy to forget sometimes, but those moments are what really matter.\""], [46, "Journey", "\"Couldn't have said it better myself. \""], [47, "Riley", "\"It really is. Sometimes I need a reminder to slow down and appreciate the little things.\""], [48, "Journey", "\"It really is a balancing act, isn't it?  Enjoying the journey without getting swept away.\""], [49, "Riley", "\"That's a perfect way to put it."], [50, "Journey", "\"Couldn't agree more.\""]]
