What kind of seafood did they highlight in the documentary?\n\n"], [9, "Cinemara", "The documentary mentioned a dish called \"poisson gros sel,\" which is a whole grilled fish seasoned with sea salt and local herbs. It looked incredibly flavorful. Have you ever had anything like that? "], [10, "Soleil", "That sounds incredible! I've always loved the simplicity of grilling fish with fresh herbs. It lets the natural flavors shine through. Have you ever tried making it yourself? "], [11, "Cinemara", "I haven't attempted \"poisson gros sel\" myself, but I imagine it's similar to the whole grilled fish I enjoyed on a trip to the Greek Islands. The simplicity really allows the freshness of the seafood to take center stage.   "], [12, "Soleil", "I've always enjoyed pan-seared fish dishes myself. There's something about that crispy skin and tender flesh that's just irresistible.  Have you ever tried adding a squeeze of citrus to it?

They infuse the fish with a lovely smoky aroma.\n\n"], [18, "Soleil", "Cedar planks sound interesting! I usually just grill directly on a well-oiled grate.

I find they work especially well with briny fish like sea bass. "], [26, "Soleil", "I've never grilled sea bass with capers before!  I might have to give that a try. Do you have a go-to recipe or just wing it?

There's just something about cooking fish over an open flame that brings out its natural essence.
