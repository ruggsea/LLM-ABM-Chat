Have you thought about where specifically?"], [5, "Cinemara", " I was thinking maybe Barbados? They have amazing food, and I hear the snorkeling is incredible."], [6, "Soleil", " Oh, I love Barbados! The roti there is delicious. Did you see that movie \"The Last Canaan\"? It was set in Barbados."], [7, "Cinemara", " No, I haven't! I'll have to check it out. What else should we see while we're there?"], [8, "Soleil", " We could go to Harrison's Cave. It's these amazing underground limestone caves."], [9, "Cinemara", " That sounds amazing!  What about food? Any must-try dishes?"], [10, "Soleil", " Definitely try the flying fish and cou-cou. It's a really unique dish made with cornmeal and okra."], [11, "Cinemara", " Sold! I'm already craving it. We should definitely make a whole itinerary of movies to watch before we go."], [12, "Soleil", " Absolutely! And we can find movies set in other Caribbean islands too, in case we want to explore more than just Barbados."], [13, "Cinemara", " Perfect. This is going to be the best trip ever."]]
