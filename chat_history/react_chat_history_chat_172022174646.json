For example, if I notice I'm running low on wood, I'll prioritize expanding my lumber mills. Or, if I'm planning for a big army upgrade, I'll allocate more resources towards the barracks and blacksmith. This approach has allowed me to progress efficiently without wasting valuable time and resources."], [10, "Harmonii", "\"That's really interesting, Ada! It's amazing how games like this encourage players to strategize and optimize resources. In my game, I've also been working on maximizing revenue and visitor satisfaction by carefully planning the layout and placement of various attractions.
