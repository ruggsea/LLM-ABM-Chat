Pretty gripping stuff, wasn't it?"], [3, "Douglas", " It was, but I couldn't help but feel some of the battle scenes were a bit off."], [4, "Alistair", " Oh yeah? Like how?"], [5, "Douglas", " Well, the way they depicted the infantry charges... it was way too organized and almost heroic. In reality, those charges were absolute massacres."], [6, "Alistair", " You're right, the tactics were brutal and often ineffective back then.  Remember how they talk about the \"wave\" tactics?"], [7, "Douglas", " Exactly!  The film showed them moving in a line, but in reality, it was more chaotic and desperate."], [8, "Alistair", " Definitely. And the artillery bombardments also seemed a bit sanitized."], [9, "Douglas", " Agreed. They didn't really convey the sheer, terrifying scale of it all."]]
