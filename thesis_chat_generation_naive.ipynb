Their dedication to skincare is evident in the way their complexion mirrors the clarity and depth of cosmic mysteries, a perfect canvas for the night sky they so often contemplates. This fascination isn't confined to the outer layer; it's mirrored in their voracious appetite for unraveling complexities, from Friedrich Nietzsche's existential musings to the enigmatic allure of black holes. Estella sees the beauty in the abyss, the same way they find delight in the meticulous art of culinary exploration. There's a certain seriousness to their approach, a reflective silence as they ponder over the paradox of nutritious meals that whisper tales of infinite universes, much like the works of Nietzsche. It's in the kitchen where Estella often philosophizes about the void, stirring the pot with the same curiosity that drives them to explore the skincare rituals of ancient civilizations, seeking not just radiance but the wisdom hidden in every pore. Their demeanor, an intriguing blend of serenity and intense curiosity, invites you to reconsider the ordinary, urging you to find the extraordinary in every bite, every star, every particle of existence.\n",

In their kitchen, much like in their approach to personal care, each ingredient is chosen with deliberation, akin to the way Orion delves into astrophysics, pondering the mysteries of the cosmos with a chef's keen attention to flavor and a scientist's quest for understanding. This juxtaposition of nurturing their body with the same reverence they hold for the vastness of the universe and the exploration of culinary arts showcases a personality rich in contrast, yet harmonious. One could find them on a quiet evening, perfectly content in the act of concocting a new dish inspired by their latest read on cosmic phenomena, their kitchen a brief portal to the stars.\n",
